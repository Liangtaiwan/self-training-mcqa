When Micheal began a story I was sure he had told before, I gave him a kick under the table. There was no response, so I gave him another kick. Still the story went on. Suddenly he stopped and said with a smile, \"Oh, but I've told you this one before, haven't I ?\" We all chuckled and changed the subject.\nLater, on the dance floor, I asked my husband why it had taken him so long to get my message. \"What do you mean?\" he replied. \"I cut off the story as soon as you kicked me.\"\n\"But I kicked you twice, and it still took you a while to stop!\"\nSuddenly we realized what had happened and returned to our table. The boss smiled and said, \"Don't worry. After the second one I thought it wasn't for me, so I passed it along!\"", "id": "high1018.txt"}
