Early estimates  from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) show that 963 million people did not get enough to eat.\nWorld food prices have dropped since early 2008. Prices of major crops have decreased by more than half from their height earlier last year. But they remain high compared to earlier years.\nBut FAO official Hafez Ghanem says lower prices have failed to end the food crisis   in many poor countries. \"For millions in developing countries,\" he says, \"getting enough food every day to live an active and healthy life is a distant dream.\"\nThe FAO says food shortage is a threat to people's health. Today, two-thirds of the world's _ people live in just a few countries. These are India, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Ethiopia and so on.\nA report on food insecurity warns that the current economic crisis could send even more people into hunger and poverty.\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, the percentage of the people who continually go hungry fell from 34% in 1997 to 30% in 2008. But the FAO says Ghana is the only country that has reached two sets of hunger reduction targets. These were set by the 1996 World Food Summit and the Millennium Development Goals. The main reason is the growth in agricultural production in Ghana.\nThe FAO says some countries in Southeast Asia like Thailand and Vietnam have made progress in hunger reduction goals. But South Asia and Central Asia haven't, and North Korea is still in hot water.", "id": "high9718.txt"}
