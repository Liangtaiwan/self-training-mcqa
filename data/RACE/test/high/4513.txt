Standing no more than three and a half feet tall, these human ancestors hunted giant rats, lumbering lizards , and _ elephants.\nIt sounds a bit like a fairy tale, but it's true. Unearthed relics on the island uncovered the remains of a race of tiny human ancestors. Homo floresiensis, as the newly discovered species has been named, apparently could date back to 13,000 years ago. This means they have a lot in common with modern humans.\nSo how and why did these people get so small? Scientists suspect that it's due to the fact that this race lived on an isolated island with limited resources. Take the miniature elephants for example. When elephants first came to the island either by swimming or by some kind of natural land raft, they were probably close to full size. But since there wasn't much to eat, over time smaller elephants lived longer and better. The smaller the elephant was, the less it had to eat to stay strong and healthy.\nScientists call this the \"island role\", and it can apply to humans as well as animals. Given the island's sparse  food supply, it makes sense that the early humans living there would have evolved   a body size requiring less food to survive. So bigger isn't always better.\nIn the floresiensis, at least, getting smaller was the way to go.", "id": "high4513.txt"}
