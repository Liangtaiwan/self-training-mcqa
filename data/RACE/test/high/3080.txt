There are some benefits of course, as people who are breaking laws can be watched and caught using cameras and this helps keep our society and public places safe. These cameras are everywhere and most are openly visible on roads, in airports, businesses, shopping centers and government buildings and even in lifts. Even schools have started using spy cams to watch student activity and behaviour.\nThe cameras are so common now that we hardly ever even notice them. But the problem lies with the ones that are hidden away from our eyes and are unseen. Technology has helped develop tiny cameras that can be very well hidden and they can \"spy\" on shoppers, workers, babysitters and people in hotels and clubs without the people even knowing.\nIt is these spy cams that people feel are an invasion of privacy. Recently, in the US, there have been a number of court cases against babysitters whose actions have been recorded by their employers on hidden cameras.\nThe number of cameras in public and private areas is on the increase and with rising crime rates and the recent terrorist attacks, more and more surveillance cameras are being used to watch us. This means that we all have to be aware that our employers, department stores, police and even some of our friends could be spying on us at any time!", "id": "high3080.txt"}
