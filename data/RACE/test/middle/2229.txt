It felt heavy.  There was paper inside, or money perhaps. \"I'd better hand it over to the police,\" he thought. There was a police station close to his office. But, as he got off the bus, a man came to him. He seemed to be waiting for something.   \"He wants the envelope,\" Nick thought. Nick began to walk quickly, and the man hurried after him. Nick managed to lose the man in the crowd .When he entered the police station, the man was no longer in sight.\nInside the police station, Nick handed over the envelope to the policeman who was on duty.  The man opened it. The envelope was full of money, false money.\"Clearly the man made a mistake,\" the policeman said. \"He thought you were one of the gang !\"\n\"However,\" the policeman went on. \"I'm afraid I must ask you to keep quiet about all this.  We are trying to catch some very clever thieves, and we don't want them to know that we have some of the money. So you mustn't say a word to anyone-not even to your boss!\"", "id": "middle2229.txt"}
