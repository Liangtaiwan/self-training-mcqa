Afghanistan is rated the worst. The rankings appear in the new Global Age Watch Index. Help Age International published the index of 96 countries that are home to 790-million people 60 and older. Chief Executive Officer Toby Porter said, \"For too long, older people have been excluded  from international and national development planning. We have a world which is ageing fast. And what the index does is to compare and rank countries from best to worst countries in the world to grow old,\" he said. The Global Age Watch Index rates countries in four categories. \"Health, income, what we call capability - ability to carry on contributing employment. And then the final one about enabling environment - what do older people think about the environment that they live in.\"  \n\"The focus on the report this year is on pensions - on retirement income that older men and women can expect.\" The index reports only one in four older people over 65 in low and middle income countries have any kind of retirement saving. Norway gets the highest ranking in the index. Rounding out the top 10 are Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Iceland, the United States, Japan and New Zealand. Afghanistan is at the bottom of the list following many years of conflict. There are 10 African countries on the index - all near the bottom. South Africa ranks the highest among them at 80. However, Porter said South Africa is doing some positive things. \"We've seen some very encouraging public statements from some senior politicians in South Africa that they recognize the contribution and the importance of supporting their older population. South Africa is one of the so-called BRICS nations - countries with strong emerging economies. Other members include Brazil, ranked 58 - Russia, ranked 65 - India, 69 and China, 48. Porter said, \"A lot of the impetus  behind China introducing pension provision for all of her older citizens was to provide an motivation for them to start using their purchasing power earlier in their lives in spending money rather than saving it for a pension.\" Help Age International recommended African nations begin providing pensions when people turn 60. However, if countries are poor, they might not be able to institute a pension system to every eligible  person at once. Another factor is Africa's youth population, which is much greater than most parts of the world. Therefore, governments are already hard pressed to provide education and jobs.", "id": "high18631.txt"}
