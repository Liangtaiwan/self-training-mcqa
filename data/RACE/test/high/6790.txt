That was me in 1940-the youngest and smallest baggage boy at New York City's Pennsylvania Railway Station.\nAfter just a few days on the job, I began noticing that the other fellows were overcharging  passengers. I'd like to join them, thinking, \"Everyone else is doing it.\"\nWhen I got home that night, I told my dad what I wanted to do. \"You give an honest day's   work,\" he said, looking at me straight in his eye. \"They are paying you. If they want to do that,   you let them do that.\"\nI followed my dad's advice for the rest of that summer and have lived by his words ever since.\nOf all the jobs I've had, it was my experience at Pennsylvania Railway Station that has stuck with me. Now I teach my players to have respect for other people and their possession. Being a member of a team is a totally shared experience. If one person steals, it destroys trust and hurts everyone. I can put up with many things, but not with people who steal. If one of my players were caught stealing, he'd be gone.\nWhether you're on a sports team, in an office or a member of a family. if you can't trust one another, there is going to be trouble.", "id": "high6790.txt"}
