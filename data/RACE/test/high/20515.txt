Astronomers had not answered this question until two months ago. That is when two American astronomers reported on their study of all the light in the universe. They said that the universe would appear to the human eyes to be a light greenish color1.\nKarl Glazebrook and Ivan Baldry of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, reported their finding in January. They presented the research at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. They said that finding the color1 of the universe was not part of their more serious scientific research. They did it for fun.\nHowever, earlier this month, the scientists admitted making a mistake. They said their finding was much more color1ful than it should have been. They now say the light from our universe is closer to white. It is more like a milky or creamy white color1.\nTheir study attempted to show what people might see if they could observe the universe from far away. The scientists found the average color1 by combining light from about two-hundred-thousand star systems. Their information came from an observatory in New South Wales, Australia.\nThe scientists gave a number value to the color1s of the different star systems. Then they added the numbers together and found the average measurement. The scientists used this average to identify the color1 of the universe. They said it was a very pretty light green. Many newspapers and television stations reported their finding.\nOther scientists and color1 engineers attempted to reproduce the result. Mark Fairchild of the Rochester Institute discovered a mistake in the computer software program used by the Johns Hopkins scientists.\nWhen the mistake was corrected, the results changed. The new color1 of the universe is much less color1ful. It is very close to white.", "id": "high20515.txt"}
