Besides close friends, your peers include other children you know who are the same age------like people in your grade, sports team, or neighborhood. Peers may have a positive influence on each other and play important roles in each other's lives:\nPositive examples\nPeers set plenty of good examples for each other. Having peers who do well in school or do their best in a sport can influence you to work hard to realize your dream, too. Peers who are kind and helpful can influence you to build these qualities in yourself. Even peers you've never met can be role models . For example, watching someone your age compete in the Olympics or give a piano concert might inspire you to go after a dream of your own.\nFeedback  and advice\nYour peers listen and give you feedback as you try out new ideas. They can help you make decisions, too: what courses to take, whether to get your hair cut or let it grow, or how to solve a problem. Peers often give each other good advice. Your peers will be quick to tell you when they think you're making a mistake or doing something dangerous.\nSocializing \nBeing with your peers----such as classmates or teammates----gives you a chance to learn how to make friends and deal with disagreements with people.\nNew experiences\nYour peers might get you involved  in clubs, sports, or volunteer groups. Your world would be far less rich without peers encouraging you to try some new food for the first time, or listen to a CD you have never heard before.", "id": "middle1234.txt"}
