This was expressed by the equation E = mc2. But bombs were not what Einstein had in mind when he published this equation.\nIn 1929, he publicly declared that if a war broke out he would \"refuse to do war service, direct or indirect....\" His position would change in 1933, as the result of Adolf Hitler's coming into power in Germany.\nEinstein's greatest role in the invention of the atomic bomb was signing a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt urging that the bomb be built because some physicists feared that Germany might be working on an atomic bomb. Among those concerned were physicists Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner. But they had no influence with those in power. So in July 1939 they explained the problem to someone who did: Albert Einstein. After talking with Einstein, in August 1939 Szilard wrote a letter to President Roosevelt with Einstein's signature on it, which was delivered to Roosevelt in October 1939.\nGermany had invaded Poland the previous month, the time was ripe for action. That October research of a-bomb began but proceeded slowly because the invention of the atomic bomb seemed distant and unlikely. In April 1940 an Einstein letter, ghost-written by Szilard, pressed the researchers on the need for \"greater speed\".\nAs the realization of nuclear weapons grew near, Einstein looked beyond the current war to future problems that such weapons could bring. He wrote to his friend about his fear about the future use of the a-bomb.\nThe atomic bombings of Japan occurred three months after Germany gave in. \nIn November 1954, five months before his death, Einstein summarized his feelings about his role in the creation of the atomic bomb: \"I made one great mistake in my life...when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification---the danger that the Germans would make them?", "id": "high19459.txt"}
