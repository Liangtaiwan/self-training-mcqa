{"answers": ["D"], "options": [["Plots of some famous movies.", "Characters in space movies.", "Popularity of space movies.", "Mistakes made in some movies."]], "questions": ["What does the text mainly deal with?"], "article": "\"Now I just don't believe that.\" Surely all of us, at some point, have watched a movie and thought: It's simply badly researched, or, the makers must think we're fools.\nIf movies were completely scientifically accurate, they'd probably be as interesting as a Physics 101 lecture. In real life, there are no explosions in space, gas usually doesn't explode from a lit cigarette, and Bruce Willis / Jackie Chan / Will Smith would most likely be in a coma  after getting kicked in the head.\nRecently, the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph ran a humorous piece on unconvincing tech moments from some top movies. Let's see what _ are all about.\nTelegraph writer Tom Chivers' first example is from the end-of-the-world movie Independence Day, in which a character comes up with a virus capable of destroying Windows, the computer system the alien  spacecraft uses. \"It's a good thing they didn't have Norton antivirus,\" jokes Chivers.\nIt's just one case of a movie that takes a lot of license with its science. Another one Chivers mentions is from Star Wars, where glowing beams of light traveling through space look very impressive. The problem is that in space there are no air particles  for the light to reflect off. In reality, they'd not be seen, which wouldn't look so cool on the big screen.\nChivers' second piece of Star Wars nonsense is the sound the fighters make in the movies: \" the bellow  of an elephant mixed with a car driving on a wet road\". But sound needs a medium to travel through, like air. In space, there wouldn't actually be any sound at all.\nFew people would deny that the mind-bending Matrix films make for great viewing, but for Chivers, the science in the movies is a little silly.\nAnd finally: as Chivers points out, DAN is not replaceable. But this bit of elementary genetics passed the makers of the 2002 Bond film Die another Day by. In the film the villain  has \"gene therapy\" to change his appearance and his DNA, which is completely impossible.", "id": "high4521.txt"}
