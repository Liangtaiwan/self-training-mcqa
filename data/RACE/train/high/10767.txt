Today, more and more travelers in the United States are spending nights at small houses or inns   instead of hotels. They get a room for the night and the breakfast the next morning.\nRooms for the night in private homes with breakfast have been popular with travelers in Europe for many years. In the past five to ten years, these bedandbreakfast places have become popular in the United States. Many of these America's bedandbreakfast inns are old historic buildings.
