Her parents were Albanians  and member of the Roman Catholic Church. When she was seven years old, her father was murdered. She decided not to be filled with hate because of this tragedy . Instead, she would seek a life of love. This ambition led her to Ireland where she became a nun  at the age of eighteen.\nAfter only one year of training, she was sent to India to teach in a school called Loretto House, where the students were mostly from rich Indian families. After 15 years there, she left her duties as a teacher to \"follow Christ into the slums .\" Her heart led her away from the rich to the needs of the poor. She was then 36 years old.\nTeresa no longer was affiliated  with the Irish nuns who sent her to Loreto House but worked independently. However, her work was recognised by the Pope in Rome for she still was a nun. He allowed her to set up her own group, which was called the Missionaries of Charity .\nShe no longer dressed as a nun in the European or Irish tradition. Instead, she put on a sari, the local dress of the Indian people. At first, people were sceptical  about her motives. Soon, they realised she was really interested in loving poor people, even those who were dying and had no chance of survival.\nSoon, other Indian people began to spare time to help Mother Teresa. She had taught everyone that the poor and dying people need love most of all.\nIn 1979, she won the Nobel Peace Prize.", "id": "high10481.txt"}
