Wearing dirty sneakers and a shirt with holes, Don Robinson is an 81-year-old Missouri businessman. Although he's rich, he didn't use his money to buy himself a grand home. Instead, he used it to buy wild land.\nRobinson has decided to donate 843 acres of his own personal _ to the Department of Natural Resources after his death, which can then be used to create a new state park. His generous donation is the same size as New York City's Central Park. It is said that it's the largest land donation to happen in the last 25 years.\nHow did he come up with this idea? For Robinson, the idea of donation came from his respect for the land and the environment. He doesn't have children to pass it onto. He hoped that someone would make full use of it, or the land would probably turn into wasteland. A green park filled with trees can at least help deal with global warming, in addition to producing fresh air.\nRobinson has lived here in a small wooden house since 1964.One room holds his bed, a few chairs and a desk. He said he didn't care how much his donation was worth. Tom Pounders who used to work for Robinson said, \"He doesn't think material objects are important.\" He also recalled that Robinson once repaired a broken tennis shoe with a spare tire.\nRobinson has just one request for the new park that will be established after his death. He'd like it to be named the Don Robinson State Park. \"There's a lot of Robinsons, but only one me. It would be nice if people remembered to use my full name when walking through the park,\" he said.", "id": "high8329.txt"}
