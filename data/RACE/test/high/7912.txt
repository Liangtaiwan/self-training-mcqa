Send a passport photo.\" A year and a half later his east London flat is the headquarters for a global internet-based \"club\" whose members carry out good deeds for strangers every Friday.\nIt's not common for people in London to talk to strangers. If you see someone struggling with something, part of the brain goes \"I want to help\". But the trained part of the brain says: \"They will think you are mad or going to mug them\", so you walk away.\nJoin Me now has about 3,000 members around the world who do an act of kindness every Friday. For example, I'm usually out on a Friday so I go for one of the standard acts -- the unexpected cup of coffee. You might be sitting in a cafe and see an old man in the corner drinking coffee or tea, and you walk up with another cup of whatever they are drinking , and say: \" I've bought you a coffee\" and walk away. It's a pleasure to see the look of surprise on their faces. There can be some suspicion, but I think that was mostly in the early days when I didn't know how to do it properly. I would walk up quite nervously like I was doing something wrong and I didn't know when to leave. In the end, I learned through _ . Sometimes it worked, other times it didn't. I discovered that you have to walk up with confidence and humour and not \"get in their faces\". You say: \"This is for you\", then you go. It's hit-and-run kindness. And there is no point in doing it half-heartedly. You've got to do it because you really mean it.\nJoin Me is without geographical boundaries, but there are quite a few members in London, and such stories about things happen on the underground or on the buses. One lady got on the bus and put a PS10 note down and said: \"That's for me and the next nine people\". So at every stop, anyone who got on was told it was paid for. A lot of people were doing this sort of thing anyway. For them it's an excuse or reason to do something nice for a complete stranger, and it gives them the confidence to walk up and start chatting.", "id": "high7912.txt"}
