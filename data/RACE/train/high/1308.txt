As the circus packed up and left, circus officials said the show would go on, even without tigers.\nHowever, the officials cann't simply turn a blind eye to the ethical  problems left behind. Even before this tragedy , animal rights activists protested  against keeping wild animals in unnatural conditions and forcing them to suffer for the profit of circus organizers.\nIt is now time for us to take effective steps to make sure that circus animals are treated properly.\n*******************************\nCircus Safe for Animals\nOur circus recently suffered a most tragic event in its history. While we are thankful for the pity from the public, we are also astonished by the opinion expressed in \"Tragedy at the Circus. \"\nFirst, our performing animals are not taken from the wild. As to the ethical problems. we always believe humans and animals can--and should--live together nicely. To us, the performing animals are representatives of their species , and our circus is one of the only places left willing to support this special role of performing animals in the existence of the species. Those who argue that circus life is harmful to animals show little knowledge of these facts. Life in the \"wild\" is unsafe, but a continuous struggle for existence. To overlook these realities is the greatest fault against the animal kingdom.\nThis circus has proven that animals are stronger and smarter than we could imagine. Within the circus is a joyful atmosphere for both animals and humans: people are educated, and species saved.", "id": "high1308.txt"}
