Then one evening in June last year, she received a text message telling her she was out of work. \"The first two weeks were the most difficult to live through.\" she said. \"After everything I'd done for the company, they dismissed me by text! I was so angry and I just didn't feel like looking for another job. I hate everything about the city and my life.\"\nThen, Zoe received an invitation from an old school friend, Kathy, to come and stay. Kathy and her husband, Huw, had just bought a farm in north-west Wales. Zoe jumped at the chance to spend a weekend away from London, and now, ten months later she is still on the farm.\n\"The moment I arrived at Kathy's farm, I loved it and I knew I wanted to stay.\" said Zoe. \"Everything about my past life suddenly seemed meaningless.\"\nZoe has been working on the farm since October of last year and says she has no regrets. \"It's a hard life, physically very tiring.\" she says. \"In London 1 was stressed and often mentally exhausted. But this is a good, healthy tiredness. Here, all I need to put me in a good mood is a hot bath and one of Kathy's wonderful dinners.\"\nZoe says she has never felt bored on the farm. Every day brings a new experience. Kathy has been teaching her how to ride a horse and she has learnt to drive a tractor. Since Christmas, she has been helping with the lambing -- watching a lamb being born is unbelievable, she says, \"It's one of the most moving experiences I've ever had. I could never go back to city life now.\"", "id": "high2443.txt"}
