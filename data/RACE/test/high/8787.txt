But it's not so good for the tongue. Unfortunately for the US soldiers of World War II, the chocolate bars the army gave them tasted like they were intended for use in the bath.\nIn the army's defense, it wasn't trying to win any cooking awards. In fact, it specifically ordered that its chocolate bars not be too delicious, so soldiers wouldn't eat them too quickly. These bars were created for survival, not taste. \"They were awful,\" John Otto, a former army captain in World War II said, \"They were big, thick things, and they weren't any good. I tried them, but I had to be awfully hungry after I tried them once.\"\nAs unappealing as the chocolate bars were to some, others like them. Samuel Hinkle, the chemist who created the chocolate bars, pointed out that the number of bars made were far greater than the army needed. \"It soon became obvious that the generous American soldiers were sharing their valued possessions with their foreign friends, whether soldiers of other countries or local citizens.\"\nThe bars turned many hungry Europeans into friends of the United States. \"People wanted them,\" said Otto. \"You'd give them to kids. In some places they were very hungry. And they surely helped relax people about American soldiers.\"\nOtto said he never saw a European _ the chocolate. \"It was food,\" he said. \"At that time, everyone was very hungry. I saw German kids standing outside the US army kitchen. They weren't begging, just standing there very politely. When we were done, the kids would eat the food out of the garbage. They were so hungry.\"\nOther Europeans did not see chocolate until well after the war ended. \"We didn't see any Americans where I was,\" said Elizabeth Radsma, who was 25 years old when the Germans occupied her country, the Netherlands. \"Even after the war, we saw only the British. Maybe the Americans gave out some chocolates in the big cities, but we were only in a small town. Before the British, we saw only German soldiers. But chocolate? Don't make me laugh! Maybe in my dreams!\"\nA soldier in the field might have responded \"Be careful what you wish for\"--and then gratefully bit on a chocolate bar, the only food available for miles.", "id": "high8787.txt"}
