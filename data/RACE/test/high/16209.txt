This huge ship is the greatest Star Wars toy. It lights up and makes some noises. Every boy from 3 to 53 will absolutely like it, if they can find room for it. I dare say even a few grandfathers might go for it.\nBiscuit--the Loving Pup\nYou may clearly know that a pet can be a great thing to a child's development but you probably don't think that you can take care of a dog properly. The robot dog Biscuit is less likely to\nthe disorder of your house and except for a few dead batteries, won't leave any surprises on the floor. It will be a good playmate for your kids.\nJVC KD-10 Headphones\nIt's increasingly common for kids to enjoy themselves on long journeys with a portable  DVD player or an iPod MP3, but the headphones that come with expensive electronics are seldom suitable for young ears.
