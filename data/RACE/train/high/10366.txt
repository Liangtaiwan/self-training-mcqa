Which of the following best describes Doniece Sandoval?", "What can we learn from Dufty's words?", "What can be a suitable title for the text?"], "article": "San Francisco, unofficially regarded as one of the homeless capitals of the US, counts nearly 6,500 homeless people, with 4,300 living on the street.\nAmong the many problems that the homeless face is little or no access to showers. San Francisco only has about 16 to 20 shower stations to accommodate _ . But Doniece Sandoval has made it her task to change that. [:\"Homelessness is something you can't really miss,\" the 51-year-old woman said. She started Lava Mae, a sort of showers on wheels, a new project that aims to turn old city buses into shower stations for the homeless.\n\"One day I passed a woman in the street and she was very dirty and basically crying, and I heard her say that she would never be clean. But I was wondering what her opportunities were to actually get clean,\" Sandoval said.\nSandoval was inspired to start Lava Mae. The project has already been welcomed with open arms in the city. The Transportation Agency has donated one bus for the cause and is willing to donate three more if the project succeeds. Sandoval hopes the first bus will be able to hit the road in May this year. The Public Commission has also agreed to let the buses plug into fire hydrants around the city if Lava Mae pays for the water.\nOne of Lava Mae's biggest supporters is Bevan Dufty, the director of Housing Opportunity, Partnerships & Engagement under the mayor of San Francisco. \"For people who are unhoused, access to showers is very difficult. Shower buses are something that could potentially be deployed  in response to an emergency, so it is relevant to all San Franciscans,\" Dufty said. \"Doniece has done an incredible job as a citizen who cares about helping the poor. We are very excited to see Lava Mae become real soon. \"\nEach bus will have two shower stations and Sandoval expects that by 2015, they'll be able to provide 2000 showers a week.", "id": "high10366.txt"}
