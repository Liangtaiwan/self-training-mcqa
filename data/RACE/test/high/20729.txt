We each have just twenty-four hours in a day. Time is not our problems , but what we do with the limited time we have is the issue. Many people spend their days on dozens of activities , but achieve very little because they aren't concentrating on right things. The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80:20 Rule shows us that typically eighty per cent of unfocused effort generates only twenty percent of the results. The remaining eighty per cent of the results are achieved with only twenty percent of the effort . To effectively manage your time, you need to change where you are spending your time. We all have the same amount of time every day. How you spend your time is how you spend your life. Here are time management strategies, which may be helpful.\nLearn to say no\nPolitely say no should become a habit. Saying no frees up time for the things that are most important.\nMake a \"to-do\" list\n   List the tasks that need to be done in order of their importance. Save other less important things for when you have time.\nMinimize interruption\nPlan ahead. Think through projects. Look for ways to  _ interruptions. For example, close your door, don't answer the phone or work in a different space.\nCombine several activities\n   Try to do several activities at one time. While going to school,listen to taped notes. This allows up to an hour or two a day of good study review. While showering,make a mental list of the things. Above all,be creative,and let it work for you.", "id": "high20729.txt"}
