But, to everyone's surprise, a few years ago June did come to large inheritance .\nAt first June said very little about the money. As the initial shock disappeared, she became excited, June is a great believer in making lists, so I was surprised to find her writing down all the ways she would spend her new wealth.\nAs time went on, she started revising the list. What had been midway down the list was now at the top. At last, I said to her, \"You know, it isn't necessary to spend all your inheritance at once. Take come time; think about it.\" \"I know, I know,\" she answered with a little bit anger.\nThen one morning June called, \"I've decided how I want to use my new inheritance. I want to see what you think,\" she said. This wasn't something I looked forward to, but we had been friends so long.\nAs we sat, June spread a sheet of paper on the table. To my great surprise, she had written only two words: Charities, and Grandchildren-in that order. Though I had promised to keep quiet, I couldn't keep from asking how she came to this decision.\n\"Well,\" she said, \"I took your advice and thought about it.\" She added, \"Helping others means a lot to me, so I'm hoping this gift will help people in need.\"\nI interrupted, \"But what about this big apartment you most hope to have?\"\n\"At first it was hard, but it doesn't seem as important any more\", she answered with a smile.\nThen June moved her hand, and I could see a few words written in tiny letters at the bottom of the page. After having a look at the small print, I burst into laughter. June had written: AND one new wardrobe.", "id": "high10361.txt"}
