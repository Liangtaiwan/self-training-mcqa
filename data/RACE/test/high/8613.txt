But not long ago, she couldn't remember her love of the game, her parents' faces or even her name.\nAt 16, the Tennessee honor student and star athlete was hit from behind while playing in a soccer game. She fell to the ground, her head striking the hard ground. The blow knocked out nearly all of Kiger's memories.\nWith no physical  injury or unusual change in her brain, doctors thought Kiger's memory would return in a few days. But it did not. And two and a half years later, it still hasn't. Kiger--who has no memory of her family, her childhood or her life before her injury--has had to create new memories, restart relationships and relearn old skills.\n\"The only thing I had ...I could walk, write, but I didn't know what to write,\" Kiger said of the days after the accident. \"Physically, I was OK, I guess, but mentally  I was troubled.\" Doctors say long-term amnesia  brought on by a less severe brain injury like Kiger's is unusual. \"It's very rare for people to have this lasting problem with memory recovering,\" said Dr Roger Hartl at Weill Cornell Medical College.\nKiger's parents tried to help their daughter return to the life she once lived. \"She didn't know what food was,\" Kiger's mom said. \"She said, 'What is that?' I said, 'Lettuce.\" She said, 'Do I like it?' I said, 'That's up to you to decide.'\"\nKiger's natural ability on the soccer field was the one part of her earlier life that died immediately. And soon, she'll begin a new life at Slippery Rock University, where she plans to study physical therapy . Kiger said that while parts of her past still remain a mystery, she's focused  on what's to come. \"It is about my future,\" she said.", "id": "high8613.txt"}
