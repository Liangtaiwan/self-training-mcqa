Kovar, a tree-climbing instructor, recently returned to the U.S. from Brazil, where he spent time developing a tree-climbing operation thanks to the \"slow travel\" movement.\n   Slow travel, is like the slow food movement, the practice of giving fast food in favor of homegrown cooking--the kind that takes hours to prepare and enjoy. Likewise, slow travel urges visitors to experience a place's natural surroundings and learn about the ecology in a way not afforded by extreme games. \n   \"Tree climbing is a slow activity,\" says Kovar. \"It's not something you do quickly and then you're on to the next thing or event.\" There is no such thing as a quick climb, especially for beginners. This wasn't a race against the clock or the fellow climbers. In fact, tree climbing is unlikely to ever become a feature of the extreme games. Many climbers refuse competition. There has already been so much competition in the world.\n\"When you stand below the tree, it can be amazing,\" Rusel DeMaria says, looking affectionately up at Michael's Triumph, a 150-foot-tall tree. But reaching the treetop, he adds, is an entirely different feeling. Likewise, his wife, Viola Brumbaugh, kneels on the ground and asks Michael's Triumph for permission to climb. \"It goes a lot smoother that way, \"She says.\nAnd climbing has been included into many educational programs. New Tribe offers guided climbs through its school, Tree Climbing Northwest, where \"we teach enough tree biology and forest ecology to raise awareness in our students,\" says New Tribe present Sophis Sparks. \"We know that the tree climbing experience deepens personal appreciation for trees. After climbing, people value trees more and are motivated to support preservation. This is not just to preserve their playground.\"\n   Perhaps that is why he struggles with the term \"recreational tree climbing,\" saying, \"I prefer to call it inspirational tree climbing.\"", "id": "high20506.txt"}
