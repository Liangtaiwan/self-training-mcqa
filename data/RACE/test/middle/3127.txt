It was near my home. I went there with my parents and helped to get the school ready so that we could move to the new one. However, things didn't get better for the next two years.\nIt was in the fifth grade.Mrs.Wakefield was my teacher, and she was a good teacher.She did not make me feel unconfident. Instead, she did her best to let me know that I could be whatever I wanted to be.And that is just what I did.\nFor the past 22 years, I have been a fifth grade teacher.Because of Mrs.Wakefield's influence on my life, I am now encouraging students who have had difficulties in their lives to believe that they can deal with any difficulty successfully and become someone.I have won many awards  up to now, such as Teacher of the Year.I think I should thank my fifth grade teacher. She believed in me and helped me to be all that I could be.", "id": "middle3127.txt"}
