A polar vortex is a cold, thick low pressure system. The air turns counter-clockwise when on the move.\nThe polar vortex started up in Canada. After crossing the border, it moved deep into the southeastern United States. The polar vortex brought the coldest temperatures in more than 20 years to many areas. Alice Jenkins lives in Washington D.C.\n\"I have a coat on. I have three sweaters. I have two blouses. But I don't feel like I have anything on.\"\nAnother woman, named Amanda, lives nearby in Maryland.\n\"It's D.C. It's not supposed to be this cold.\"\nThe extreme weather started with a low-pressure system near the North Pole. The Arctic air was pushed as far south as Alabama on wind currents known as the jet stream. The bitter cold covered much of the central United States, forcing schools, government offices and businesses to \nclose.\nBut the polar vortex did not have the same effect everywhere.\nInterestingly enough, it is warmer in Alaska and also somewhat warmer over Greenland because when you exhaust cold air in the North Pole and the Arctic region, when it's forced southward, it can't all stay there. Basically it's rushing towards us in the United States.\"\nCamden Walker, a weather expert, says the weather system moved away quickly from places like Washington. But the cold air and high winds were staying longer in the middle of the country.\nTemperatures of minus 10 degrees Celsius or lower were reported in Washington, New York, Boston and Philadelphia. In fact, temperatures in all or parts of the 50 states were below freezing at some point on Tuesday. Even in Hawaii, it was minus six degrees at the top of the state's highest mountain. \nThe effect of the polar vortex was extensive. Airline companies cancelled more than 11,000 flights over a four day period. The cold weather also interfered with train service. In the south, the Tennessee Valley Authority said it set a single day record for electricity as homeowners struggled to stay warm. But there was more to the picture.", "id": "high17784.txt"}
