He is always in a good mood and always has something positive to say.\nOne day I went up to Michael and asked him, \"I don't get it. You can't be positive all the time. How do you do it?\" Michael replied, \"Each morning I wake up and say to myself 'Mike, you have two choices today. You can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad mood.' I choose to be in a good mood. Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or choose to learn from it. I choose to learn from it. Every time someone comes to me complaining  I can choose to accept their complaining or I can point out the positive side of life. I choose the positive side of life.\"\nI often thought about that when I made a choice about life. Several years later, Michael was involved in a serious accident, falling off 60 feet from a communica-tion tower. After l8 hours of operation, and weeks of intensive care, Michael was re-leased from the hospital with rods placed in his back.I asked him what had gone through his mind as the accident took place.\n\"The first thing that went through my mind was the well being of my soon-to-born daughter,\" Michael replied. \"Then, as I lay on the ground, I remembered I had two choices: I could choose to live or I could choose to die. In the operation room, I told the doctors and nurses, 'I'm choosing to live. Operate on me as if I am alive, not dead'.\"\nMichael lived, thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because of his amazing attitude.", "id": "high8404.txt"}
