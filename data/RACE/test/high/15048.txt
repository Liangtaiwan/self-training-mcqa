With two teenage boys and three little boys, our family is restless--to the baseball field, track field and piano lessons. Even though we've limited each boy's activities and try our best to defend our family time, it seems that we're in a constant state of flight.\n\"Embrace it. Roll with it,\" my husband, Lonny, says, \"It's going to be like this for a while.\"\nHe is right. It's likely that life will continue to go forward before it slows down. But I remembered the still, quiet days that our family used to enjoy. I missed long walks through the park when we held the boys' little hands.
