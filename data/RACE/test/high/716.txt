The first grade teacher gave her class a fun task----to draw a picture of something for which they were thankful.\nMost of the class would celebrate the holiday with turkey  and other traditional goodies  of season. These, the teacher thought, would be the subjects of her students' art. And they were. But Douglas made a different kind of picture. He drew a hand. Nothing else. Just an empty hand. Douglas was a different kind of boy. Most of the time, as other children played together, Douglas was likely to stand close by her side. Everyone could guess the pain he felt from his eyes.\nHis picture interested other students. Whose hands could it be? One child guessed it was the hand of a farmer, because farmers raise turkeys. Another suggested a police officer, because the police protect and care for people. Still others guessed it was the hand of God, for Gold feeds us.\nThe teacher stopped at Douglas desk, bent down, and asked him whose hand it was. The little boy looked away and said, \" It's yours, teacher.\"\nShe recalled the times she had taken his hand and walked with him here and there. How often had she said, \"Take my hand, Douglas, we' ll go outside.\" or, \" Let me show you how to hold your pencil.\" Douglas was thankful for his teacher's hand. It means much to Douglas. He might not always say thanks, but he'll remember the hand that reaches out. She wiped her tears away and went on with her work.", "id": "high716.txt"}
