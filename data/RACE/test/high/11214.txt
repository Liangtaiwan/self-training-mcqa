Go into it and _ on how you stole the goat!\"\nThe young man had been a thief for a long time and admitted the goat was stolen by him.He asked the blind man puzzlingly, \"But how do you know I am a thief?\"\nThe blind man smiled, \"I have been keeping goats for decades and can tell one of them is male or female as well as their age according to their voices.The goat you led just now is obviously a male goat, but you said female.The goat is simply a little more than one year old, but you said you had kept it for three years.Moreover, the goat will bleat totally differently when he is led by a stranger instead of his owner.So I can tell the goat does not belong to you!\" Only then did the thief understand the whole thing with his head dropped down.", "id": "high11214.txt"}
