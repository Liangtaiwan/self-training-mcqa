He moves his little fingers like wings.\n\"You are?\" I say. I'm sitting across from him while he eats breakfast at our table. I smile; he says the greatest things. A week ago, however, when he had chocolate on his face and I licked   my finger to wipe it off, he said, \"Don't put your dirty water on me.\"\nA week ago, I wouldn't have been sitting here with him during breakfast. I wouldn't have been up, emptying the dishwasher, cleaning the kitchen, or answering emails. We always had dinner together at the table, but other meals got much less attention.

I have to eat, too. My husband is Jack's favorite, which delights and moves me, but I am Jack's constant. Constants are there. Constants sit down.\nSo I've been sitting. And, surprise, I haven't missed a deadline. The house has been clean. And Jack seems to like having me there. Two days ago, over lunch, he smiled and stared at me.\n\"What?\" I asked, amused.\n\"Mommy, I love you so much and I can't stop loving you.\"\nI could have missed that.\nGod, I could have missed _ .", "id": "high9884.txt"}
