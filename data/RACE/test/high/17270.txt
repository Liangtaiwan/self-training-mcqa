She was covered by a destroyed house. Through gaps   of those ruins,the rescuers could see her last posture  . It was something like an ancient person who was kowtowing  ,but it just looked strange because she was out of shape by pressure.\nThe rescuers confirmed her death by touching her through the gaps of the ruins. They shouted at the ruins again and again,knocked the bricks using various tools,but no reply inside.\nThen the rescuing team went to the next building. Suddenly the leader ran back,calling \"Come here.\" He came to the body,put his hands under the woman,feeling and touching,then shouted loudly and gladly,\"There is someone,a baby,still living.\"\nThrough some efforts,rescuers cleaned up the ruins which blocked her. Under her body lay her baby,who was covered by a small red quilt . He was about 3 or 4 months' old. Since well protected by his mother's body,he was safe. He was in a deep sleep when the rescuer carried him out,and his lovely and peaceful face warmed everyone around him. The doctor,along with the rescuing team,took the baby out of the quilt to check if the baby was all right,and he found there was a mobile phone in the quilt. The doctor looked at the screen;a written message was already there:\"My dear baby,if you could live,don't forget how much I love you.\" As a doctor,he experienced much of this type of separation;but at this moment,he cried. The mobile phone was passed,and every person who saw this message shed  tears.", "id": "high17270.txt"}
