B.C.--For six months. Ted Schredd and Deanna Kopel cycled around North America to show others a way to help the environment. \"Nobody wants to breathe dirty air--but for the air to change. People have to stop driving cars,\" says Ted, \"If more people start riding bikes, the air will be cleaner.\"\nTed started his trip alone. He had $160 in his pocket and plans to cycle around North America. He left his hometown of Vancouver, and when he arrived in San Diego he got the chance to make some extra money for the rest of his 13, 000 km trip. A cyclist he met asked him to speak at an environment meeting in Texas. Within a few hours, Ted was on a plane to the meeting and a big surprise.\nWhen he met Deanna at the meeting, they talked for six hours straight. It was love at first sight. The next day, he called her to ask if she wanted to finish the trip with him. She said yes, sold everything in her flat, gave her notice at work, and was on the road with Ted three weeks later.\nDeanna found Ted's timetable difficult because he got up early in the morning. Deanna was a nurse and usually worked at night. \"All of a sudden, I was up at six when I wanted to sleep until noon,\" said Deanna.\nAs the couple cycled to Florida and up to Montreal and then back to Vancouver, every day was an adventure. They got free meals in restaurants, and slept in people's yards. When they ran out of money, people gave them extra cash. Sometimes people gave away $50 or $100.\nAnd like all good stories this one has a happy ending. On the way back to Vancouver, they stopped in Edmonton to visit Ted's relatives. During the visit, they got married. People tied ten cans and a \"Just Married\" sign to the back of their bikes.\nThey now want to write a book about their trip. \"We want people to know that you can protect our earth and still have fun,\" Schredd said.", "id": "high14303.txt"}
