I don't want to ruin my hairstyle.\"\nBush then announced his choice. \"Now it's my right to challenge my friend Bill Clinton to the ALS Challenge,\" he said. \"Yesterday was Bill's birthday and my gift to him is a bucket of cold water.\"\nThe online campaign challenges people to either dump a bucket of ice water over their heads or donate to support research for Lou Gehrig's disease.
