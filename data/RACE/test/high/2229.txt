This homemade, creamy treat is a summertime delight for your kids and you alike.\nWhat you'll need:\n1 tablespoon of sugar; 1/2 cup of milk; 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla  ; 6 tablespoons of rock salt; 1 small-sized plastic food storage bag; 1 gallon-sized plastic food storage bag; ice cubes.\nHow to make it:\nl Fill the large bag half full of ice, and add the rock salt. Seal the bag.\nl Put milk, vanilla, and sugar into the small bag, and seal it.\nl Place the small bag inside the large one, and seal it again carefully.\nl Shake until the mixture turns into ice cream, which takes about five minutes.\nl Wipe the top of the small bag, and then open it carefully. Enjoy!\nTips:\n1/2 cup of milk will make about one spoon of ice cream, so double the recipe if you want more. But don't increase the amount more than _ --a large amount might be too big for kids to pick up because the ice itself is heavy.\nHere is another version of the homemade ice cream recipe from another parent!\nThese are the homemade ice cream ingredients:\n1/4 teaspoon of vanilla butter and nuts; 1 tablespoon of sugar; 1/2 cup of milk.\nThese are the other supplies:\nPlastic sandwich bag; 12 salt pellets; 1 dish of ice; large plastic bag.\nPut the ice cream ingredients in the small bag, and then put the bag, salt and ice in the big bag. Hold the bag shut and move it around on the floor for about 5 minutes.\nWhen I made ice cream at home last time, although the salt pellets didn't really dissolve   that well, I still got ice cream. It was not smooth ice cream, probably because of the low-fat milk. It was incredible that it could be ready in 5 minutes (not counting preparing the ingredients)\nNext, I changed the recipe, using a tablespoon of cocoa, a tablespoon of sugar, and a cup of milk. It was a bit too chocolaty, but good!", "id": "high2229.txt"}
