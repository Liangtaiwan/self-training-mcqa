The idea is borrowed from the way mother kangaroos carry their young in front in a pouch. The baby kangaroo stays in this built-in baby carrier until it can survive independently.\nKangaroo mother care is also known as the skin-to-skin method for premature  babies. The direct contact with the mother keeps the baby warm. It also lets the baby breastfeed  at any time. The mother's heartbeat also helps control the baby's breathing rate.\nEvery year, seven thousand babies are born at the health center where Ousmane Ndiaye works in Guediaway, outside Dakar. One in five is underweight. But Senegal has few incubators  in which to keep premature babies warm. In Africa, one newborn in twenty dies. A major reason is prematurity, so the death rates are among the highest in the world.\nDoctor Ndiaye says babies who weigh less than two kilos get special attention from _ who assist with the births. They teach the mother how to keep the baby wrapped to her chest. The health center has a Kangaroo Clinic, a special area for teaching this method.\nDoctor Ndiaye says they plan to expand the program throughout Senegal. But he believes the best way to get more people to use the kangaroo method is for mothers who have used the method to tell others about it.", "id": "high21625.txt"}
