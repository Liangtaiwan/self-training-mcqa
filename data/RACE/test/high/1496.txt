Each child (aged 12-13) beatified a box and wrote a story on the subject of collections to throw inside it. The boxes were spread within the Royal Festival Hall's Ballroom. Some were left empty to encourage\nThe subject chosen by Luren was an imaginative one. \"It's a sort o f Cinderella   story,\" she told me, inspired by a collection of letters from her cousin, ha the story these become love letters, burned by a creel stepmother. Lauren's best friend Charlotte is the stepmother. \"I'm in Charlotte's story too,\" says Lauren, \"and I get run over.\" Charlotte's tale was inspired by the girls' coin collection. \"We've collected foreign coins for years - since our families went on holiday to Tenerife.\" she explains. \"That was before the Euro, so we put pesetas in.\" Lauren continues: \"I fred a coin in the road, go to get it and get run over.
