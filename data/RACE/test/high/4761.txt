You might not think so, but people in China eat on average   about 12 grams of salt each day, that is much higher than the 6 grams suggested by the World Health Organization. You could be eating too much without realizing it, because about 75% of the salt we eat is already in the food we buy, such as bread, sauces, soups and sausages.\nWhat problems can eating too much salt cause? To answer that question, first let's take a look at what salt is.\nSalt is a chemical compound. It is made of sodium   and chloride  . Salt is used to keep and flavor foods. A small amount of salt is important for good health because our bodies need sodium and chloride to work.\nBut past studies have found that people who eat more salt than they need tend to have high blood pressure. Eating too much salt has also been connected with other conditions, such as heart and kidney   problems.\nIf you want to cut down on salt, the good news is, there are plenty of simple things to do. Here are some tips:\n*Cut back on high salt foods.\nMost foods contain some salt. But some foods such as cheese, bacon, pickles  , smoked fish and chips are almost always high in salt because of the way they are made. You can still enjoy them, but try to have these in smaller amounts, or eat them less often.\n*Choose reduced salt bread and breakfast cereals.\nBread and breakfast cereals   are major source of salt in the diet, not that they're necessarily high in salt but because we eat a lot of them. For these foods, there can be a really big difference between different types and brands. So next time you're shopping, take the time to compare the salt levels on a few similar products. And always try to choose the ones lower in salt.\n*Avoid adding salt to cooking and at table. Instead, you could use herbs and spices   such as garlic   and lemon juice to add flavor to meals.", "id": "high4761.txt"}
