There were four of them and there were four totally different cups on the table.\nThey took their tea cups.\n\"What quote?\" Mary asked.\n\"Well, maybe I should rather say it is a story,\" aunt said, \"I heard that there was a wise teacher who took all his students for tea. They were surprised that all the cups on the table were different. Each of them took a cup and started drinking their tea, each looking at the cups of others. The teacher let them do that for a while and then said,' Do you notice your behavior? You are all looking at each other's tea cup and I can see some of you with the broken ones are even envious  of the finer cups of others. Is this not so?' \"\nThe students agreed, amused by their own behavior.\n\"You may have wondered why you all had different cups, but I put them here on purpose. You see they represent   life itself. Life is like that tea and the cups are like the physical circumstances  of your life. You all got the same thing in your cups -- tea. And yet you can not truly enjoy it in your envy of another's cup. It's just the same with life. You forget to enjoy your own life when you concentrate on envying the circumstances of someone else's life.\nSo now, close your eyes, and taste your own tea. Really taste it. And tell me -- did it matter from which cup it came from?\"\nAunt finished telling her short tea story and they all sat in silence for a while, tasting their tea. A sleepy fly buzzed  past, a bird sang in the tree. And it really did not matter one bit from which tea cup they drank.", "id": "high11392.txt"}
