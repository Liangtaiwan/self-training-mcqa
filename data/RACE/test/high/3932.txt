Not necessarily, says Dr. Silva, a professor in Sociology  at the Open University, she also argues it is wrong to assume technology erodes(,) the quality of family life.\n\"There is the idea that technology has an influence on the family and the family suffers. My take is quite different,\" she explains. \"Technological change happens because people's lives change. And it is people's choices of how to live that creates processes of innovation  as well. The family has a role like the economy or like technology itself in changing the world. The imagination is important in driving the things technologists want to find for our daily lives. People desire to see nature as it is, so color television comes about,\" she says.\nIn another case, the increase in working mothers helped create a market for labor-saving kitchen equipment. \"The time that women have to shop every day for food is no longer available so there is a need to have a refrigerator for food storage,\" says Dr. Silva. \"The need to cook that food more easily and quickly, means you have developments in cooking technology like the microwave oven . The microwave oven already existed because it was developed for the navy during World War Two but it wasn't used in ordinary families until the early 1980s.\n\"Technologies for housework were as important as those for work itself,\" she says, \"So washing machines, refrigerators and microwave ovens are terribly important. We couldn't imagine what life would be like if we didn't have them.\" Technological changes in the kitchen have played an important role in the changes of family behavior, creating a new social focus in the home.\n\"With advanced technology, you can feed the family in an easier manner. People can do housework with less difficulty. But that doesn't mean that family practices are not important -- it's just a different way of doing things.\"", "id": "high3932.txt"}
