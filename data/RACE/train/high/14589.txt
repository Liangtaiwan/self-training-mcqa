BigThink.com is a new website that allows Internet users to discuss certain topics with world experts  . Subjects discussed on BigThink include the environment, music and questions about happiness and personal identity. The website has been called a YouTube for thinkers. Victoria Brown and Peter Hopkins created BigThink.com. They said that people needed an international place to communicate with each other and discuss the important issues   of our times. On the BigThink website, when you click on a subject, you will find a video of a person talking about his or her ideas. For example, you can listen to United States Senator Ted Kennedy talking about education and other things. Besides, you can read the comments and questions written by other visitors to the website. More than one hundred experts have expressed their ideas on the website. BigThink's creators   started the website by first getting famous people to agree to be videoed. They began by interviewing several well-known professors from Harvard University. Then they used the names of these professors to gain the trust of others and get them to take part in the project. The website says BigThink belongs to everyone. Its motto   is: \"We are what you think.\" So, go online and start thinking big.", "id": "high14589.txt"}
