In fact,although the total pedestrian casualty  rate has fallen over the last ten years,there has been an increase in accidents caused when pedestrians have to step out into the mad to avoid parked cars on the pavement and cannot see oncoming traffic.\n    I cannot share Mr.Hogg's view that the government have paid little attention to\"long-suffering motorists\":and I think the punishment for dangerous parking should be made severe enough to stop all motorists from breaking the law in this way.\nA WALKER,\nProudfoot Lane,Carchester", "id": "high20660.txt"}
