A large sea turtle lays around 150 eggs at a time. She lays all these eggs in just a few minutes.\nLarge sea turtles live in the warm seas of the world.

When it is time to lay their eggs, the females  swim to land.\nThey usually return to the place where they themselves were born. How they find their way back there is unknown.\nWhen they reach shore, the big, heavy turtles crawl slowly up to the high water mark. Using their flippers, they pull themselves along the sand.
