Most of the letters he received were interesting and quite easy to answer. Then came a letter from a person named Joe.\n\"Dear Amy,\" it began, \"I'm in real trouble. I've wanted to be a songwriter all my life, but my parents don't even let me take music lessons. I have a guitar, but they both get angry if I play. I've tried explaining, but they didn't listen. I feel sad. Should I run away from home? Maybe that will make my parents agree.\" The letter signed \"Joe\".\nAndy thought about this letter for a long time. Should he advise someone to run away from home? Probably not. But didn't Joe have a right to be a songwriter if he wanted to? Andy thought hard, but couldn't think out a good answer. Andy couldn't sleep. He just worried about poor Joe.\nAt a bar a few days later, Eleanor, a girl in Andy's maths class, sat down next to him and asked, \" What's wrong with you? You look a little worried.\"\n\"I guess I do,\" said Andy.\n\"If you get a problem, why don't you try writing to Dear Amy about it?\" asked Eleanor.\nAndy sighed. But Eleanor continued, \"In fact, I guess Dear Amy is rather busy with other problems. She still hasn't answered the _ letter I wrote her last week. You'd better read it -- it may even make the most hard-hearted person cry! It was supposed to be from a songwriter named Joe.\"", "id": "middle1597.txt"}
