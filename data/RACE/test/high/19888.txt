Through the years Iwould take a guess at what I thought was the correct answer. When I was younger, I thought sound was very important to us as humans, so I said: \"My ears, Mommy.\" She said: \"No. Many people are deaf. But you keep thinking about it and I will ask you again soon.\"Several years passed before she asked me again. Since making my first attempt, I had contemplated the correct answer. So this time I told her: \"Mommy, sight is very important to everybody, so it must be our eyes.\" She looked at me and told me: \"You are learning fast, but the answer is not correct because there are many people who are blind.\"\nMother asked me a couple more times and always her answer was \"No. But you are getting smarter every year, my child.\"Then last year, my grandpa died. Everybody was hurt. Everybody was crying. My momlooked at me when it was our turn to say our final goodbye to grandpa. She asked me: \"Do you know the most important body part yet, my dear?\"\nI was  shocked  when  she  asked  me  this  now. She  told  me:  \"This  question is very important,especially at this moment. How you answer it can truly shows whether you have\nlearned about life. For every body part you gave me in the past, I have told you were wrong\nand I have given you an example why. But today is the day you need to learn this important\nlesson.\"\nI saw her eyes well up with tears. She said: \"My dear, the most important body part is your\nshoulder.\"\"Is it because it holds up my head?\" I asked.\"No, it is because it can hold the head of a friend or a loved one when they cry,\" she replied:\"Everybody needs a shoulder to cry on somet ime in life, my dear. I only hope that you have enough love and friends that you will always have a shoulder to cry on when you need it.\"", "id": "high19888.txt"}
