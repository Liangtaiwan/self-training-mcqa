Their job is delightful.They read the latest book and then write reviews on the ones they like.Then there are those who write on fdms,so they get to see them even before they are shown in the cinema.How lucky, you would say!\nA reporter's job can also be very dangerous.If there is a flood or a riot they may get hurt or even be killed.Three years ago there was a reporter whose camera was destroyed by a group of men,because they were angry with him for taking their picture.Dangerous or not,one thing is certain,and that is,their job is never dull!", "id": "high7036.txt"}
