Educationists from China and the US try to find out the answer to questions like this at a forum on the basic education strategy.\nThe forum, held recently, was jointly organized by the Education Development Research Center of the Ministry of Education in China and the Postgraduate School of the University of Pennsylvania in the US. It aims to find out similarities and differences that exist between two countries in their educational system.\nWhile some educationists in China keep a doubtful eye to the country's educational system in recent years. Their American counterparts give a positive answer to the basic education in China, saying that it is still one of the best in the world.\nAn American educationist told reporters that the basic education in the US was criticized in recent years due to its political tendency. On the contrary, Chinese government's stress on basic education and qualified teachers has set a good example.\nAt primary and middle school, pupils in China did better in math and science lessons than the US pupils. However, few grow to be world \"masters\". Why? Educationists attributed this to China's stress on examination rather than students' interest.\nDeputy Director of the postgraduate school of Pennsylvania University said American teachers encouraged students to focus on their strong points. In China, students are driven to study to pass the entrance examination test and they do not pay much attention to their own interest.\nAt the forum, director of the Education Development Research Center Mr. Zhang said in the future, the research center would make its middle and long-term basic education strategy by taking some references from other countries including the US.\nHe also revealed that for a long time in the future, China would make a breakthrough in setting the policy for quality education.", "id": "high2822.txt"}
