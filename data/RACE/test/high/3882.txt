It was early, there were few other cars on the road and we were looking forward to a good day with the family. Suddenly, a moose rushed across our path. Fortunately, a quick swerve  to the other lane prevented a full impact, with only a small collision on the right side of our car ripping off the mirror and knocking the moose to the pavement.\nBy the time I stopped and looked back in my rear view mirror, the moose was getting up. It ran into the bush. Shaken but unharmed, we both looked at each other shocked by what had happened. We knew that moose accidents had claimed many lives throughout the years, and that we had been very fortunate to escape with no personal injury or worse. After a quick check of our vehicle, we drove off.\nEven though the moose accident lasted just a few seconds, we still remember it to this day. Why?\nWe had often talked about the frailty of life, the here today and gone tomorrow potential we all face, but it had never felt so real. And it wasn't that we hadn't had friends, relatives and colleagues die before, it was that this experience was much more personal. In a matter of seconds, lives can easily change.\nThe effect of that one near miss with death has been positive, and made us appreciate life. Each one of us has only a limited time on this Earth; no one can predict when your time will end. We should give thanks for each day, to see the sun rise again, and to know that you can accomplish and assist others to appreciate their life if they are caught in the \"poor-me\" syndrome .", "id": "high3882.txt"}
