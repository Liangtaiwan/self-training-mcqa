The doctors said there was little chance of my coming out of it, but my identical twin, Marcus, didn't believe them and carried on talking to me. My first words when I came to myself were, \"Hello, Marcus. \"Even though I had no memory of my own name, or that the woman crying at my bedside was my mother, I knew Marcus immediately; it was like a genetic memory. just felt close to him.\nAs weeks went by, I still could remember nothing before the accident. Marcus was the only person I could relate to.\nI had to relearn everything, and Marcus helped me. Because of my twin I wasn't scared of having lost my memory; I believed everything he said. He became my memory, telling me about my school, friends, previous girlfriends and holidays, showing me family photographs, and telling me how perfect I was.\nWith his encouragement I slowly recovered and tried to become the person everyone around me loved. Then years later, when my memories flooded back, I learned that I was anything but perfect--I was troublesome, selfish, and now very angry with Marcus for having lied to me.\nBut finally I understood. Out of love, Marcus had chosen not to tell me about my dark side. He wanted me to have a fresh start--and in fact I had one. Thanks to him, I was able to get married and have kids. I'm 46 now, and feel as if I'm in the third stage of my life. I know all there is to know, and wouldn't want it any other way.", "id": "high15413.txt"}
