Under the Dome, a 103-minute documentary self-funded by former CCTV news anchor Chai Jing was released on video-sharing websites in China on Feb 28. It has rapidly pushed the public awareness about air pollution and encouraged people to join in efforts to make a difference.\nChai, 39, said she started the work out of her \"personal clashes\" with smog after she gave birth to a daughter. \"I sealed tight all the windows. I started every day by checking the air pollution index,\" Chai said. Millions of other people are also doing the same. While they stop there, Chai goes deeper. \"I don't want to live in this way. 1 need to find out where the smog comes from and what on earth is going on.\"\nOver a year, she investigated polluted sites to find the sources of smog, visited the US and the UK to learn about their anti-pollution experiences, and interviewed officials, scientists and the general public. Chai's research reveals that the burning of coal and oil contributes to 60 percent of PM2.5 pollutants. She thus questions the country's energy consumption habits in the film.\nShe then goes on to disclose loopholes   in car emissions regulations. The film also explains that businesses are pressured not to abide by  the laws because violating  them carries little or no cost, while making changes bumps up costs. The film also points at China's petroleum and steel industries as the biggest sources of air pollution.\nCheng Chen, a 22-year-old student from Beijing Foreign Studies University, found the documentary \"very inspiring\". \"I used to think it's not my duty to deal with air pollution--I don't own a factory or a car,\" said Cheng. \"But Chai told me we share the same fate since we breathe the same air and there is a lot I can do.\"\nHowever, some people are annoyed by the film's description of their polluted hometowns, especially when it shows a banner from Xingtai in Hebei saying \"Congratulations to our city for no longer being ranked the last place among the country's 74 cities in terms of air quality\".\n _ \"What's important is that Chai's work has raised public attention toward the structure of the energy industry,\" she said.   Meanwhile, experts remind moved viewers of the film's limitations.", "id": "high9932.txt"}
