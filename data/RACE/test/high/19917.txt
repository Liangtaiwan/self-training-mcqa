Those who speak with an accent that \"often impedes\" comprehension will not pass. These rules take effect in January 2016.\nChina's 56 ethnic groups speak more than 80 languages and dialects. Even native Mandarin speakers can have trouble communicating with each other depending on the strength of their accents, which can be mutually unintelligible  .\nOne flight trainer illustrated the scope for linguistic confusion, especially when common English aviation terms are used. Asked if there is a problem on board, a Chinese pilot might answer in the negative with the words mei you, or \"there isn't. But someone speaking with a heavy Sichuan accent would pronounce mei you as \"May day\" - unconsciously parroting the universally recognized distress call  . \nLike their international counterparts  , Chinese aviators have developed codes to avoid confusion resulting from homonyms   or near-homonyms. They use the terms yao for one and guai for seven, which are otherwise pronounced yi and qi respectively and easily confused.\nThe new rule could affect all pilots, who must renew their license every six years, and adds to a growing list of burdens for the profession.", "id": "high19917.txt"}
