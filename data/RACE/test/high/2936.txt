I drove my mother crazy ! But after a few years, my obsession stars faded as I matured and gained the confidence to socialize with \"real\" boys.\nIn the 35 years since I was a teenager, celebrity worship   has increased among teens due to the explosion of television celebrity gossip shows, and instant access to celebrity news on the Internet. It's no wonder that many teens are obsessed with stars when news programs are often filled with entertainment stories and the lives of celebrities.\nCelebrity worship syndrome   is now considered a personality disorder.
