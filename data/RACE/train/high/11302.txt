At other crossroads, drivers have to go slow, but they do not actually have to stop unless, of course, there is something coming along the main road; and at still others, they do not have either to stop or to go slow, because they are themselves on the main road.\nMr. Williams, who was always a very careful driver, was driving home from work one evening when he came to a crossroad. It had a \"SLOW\" sign. He slowed down when he came to the main road, looked both ways to see that nothing was coming, and then drove across without stopping completely.\nAt once he heard a police whistle  , so he pulled into the side of the road and stopped. A policeman walked over to him with a notebook and a pen in his hand and said, \"You didn't stop at that crossing.\"\n\"But the sign there doesn't say 'STOP'.\" answered Mr. Williams, \"It just says 'SLOW', and I did go slow.\"\nThe policeman looked around him, and a look of surprise came over his face. Then he put his notebook and pen away, scratched   his head and said, \"Well,I'm in the wrong street!\"", "id": "high11302.txt"}
