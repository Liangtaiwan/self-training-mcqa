They believe politicians could learn a lot from recent advances in science. A growing number of studies have shown that people do judge a book by its cover. Researchers say most of us make quick judgments about a person on the basis of how they look.\n  Studies suggest that people are less likely to trust those with particularly masculine  features, such as a square jaw, small eyes or a big nose. \" They are considered dominant  and less trustworthy,\" says Ms Cornwell. \"It doesn't mean that men who look more masculine are less trustworthy-----it's just our first impression.\" Those with less masculine features-----larger eyes, a smaller nose and thinner lips are thought to be more trustworthy.\n  The researchers are putting their science to the test at the Royal Society's annual summer exhibition in London. They have copied the faces of Prime Minister Tony Blair, Conservative leader Michael Howard and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy stressing their dominant and trustworthy features. \" We have used a computer program to change the shape of their faces and features. We hope it will help people to understand our work.\"\n  So should we expect to see them at the exhibition getting tips?\n  \"I don't think it's something they will want to try,\" says Ms Cornwell. \"It's not really possible with television. We all know what they look like.\"", "id": "high17205.txt"}
