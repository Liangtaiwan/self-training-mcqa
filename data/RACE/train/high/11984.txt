At current emission   levels, global temperatures are likely to rise by about 2 degrees by midcentury and about 7.5 degrees by the end of the century.\nThe most vulnerable   Americans -- the poor, elderly, sick, very young and immigrants -- will suffer more. That's at least 10 percent of the country's population, probably more. It will be tougher for these people to get enough health care for climate-related illnesses, to cool down in heat waves, to escape extreme events such as Hurricane Katrina, and even to get enough food.\nWhile every region of America is vulnerable to global warming's health and welfare effects, more people are moving to coastal regions, which are most vulnerable to climate change because of drought and hurricanes.", "id": "high11984.txt"}
