I lived with my grandparents on a farm in Alabama. It wasn't unusual for me to go to the woods. And I enjoyed that. From the time I was 6 to 16 years old I was an actor. My mom asked me to audition\n  for a show in Birmingham. I asked my mom to buy me some video games and she promised  , so I got the part. Later, I became a professional actor. So for several years I went everywhere from the Alabama farm to many other cities -- all over the USA doing stage productions.\nReporter: How did you get into your field of work?\nDollar: I grew up on a farm and I was really a wild child and came to love wild things. I did a lot of photography in high school. I became a photographer and did photography for the local paper. Then I became a student of Duke University. Duke has a primate   centre -- Lemur Centre. I got a job there as a work study student and met lemurs there for the first time.\nLater I had a chance to go to Madagascar and decided to study lemurs.\nReporter: What's the one thing you can't travel without?\nDollar: A sense of humour   or a can-do attitude is necessary, but my first response   was soy sauce. If we run out of soy sauce, the journey is over.\n,.", "id": "middle3325.txt"}
