Want to know more?\n    After you get up,your apartment will be like an electronic orchestra with you as the conductor.With simple moves of your hand and spoken instructions,you'll be able to control your apartment's temperature,humidity,music and lighting.You'll be able to look through the day's news on translucent screens while your breakfast waits for you in the automatic oven.\n    As you move into your kitchen,maybe you will stub your toe on the edge of a cabinet. You'll grab your cell phone and open the diagnostics app.Inside your phone there will be a tiny microchip that uses X-ray waves to scan your body. The scan will reveal that your toe is just slightly hurt,not broken,which will convince you not to see a doctor.\n    After breakfast,your driverless car will take you to work.While you drive,your central computer system will suggest a list of chores your housekeeping robots could see to today and it will also remind you to buy a gift for your mother's upcoming birthday.\n    As you can see,with the help of advanced technologies,our lives will be more efficient. Teehnology will mitigate our forgetfulness and free us of many small burdens that distract us, such as buying a ticket or trying to remember our kids' parent-teacher meeting.Our brain will therefore be able to focus on more important things like preparing for a presentation or doing \"deep thinking\".\n    However,the development of technology might have some disadvantages as well. By 2033,we'll be relying heavily on the virtual world,which will mean that all of our data will be stored in the cloud,a remote digital storage system with near limitless capacity. That will increase the possibility of someone else accessing,sharing or controlling our personal information.", "id": "high17911.txt"}
