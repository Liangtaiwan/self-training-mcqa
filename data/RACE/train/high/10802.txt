It was another attack of lung illness. My husband and I stayed with him for the weekend but had to return to our jobs on Monday. Local relatives would help Dad get home from hospital and look after him. But I longed to be able to let him know that we cared about him too, even when we weren't with him.\nThen I remembered a family tradition when our children were small. When leaving our grandparents' home after a visit, each child would write a love note to their grandparents. We hid notes in a box, under a hairbrush or next to the phone or even in the microwave oven. For days, our grandparents would smile as they discovered these reminders of our love.\nSo as I tidied Dad's kitchen and made up a bed for him downstairs in the living room, I wrote some notes. Some were practical, \"Dad, I put the food in the fridge so it wouldn't spoil\". Some expressed my love, \"Dad, I hope you will sleep well in your new bed.\" Most notes were downstairs where he would stay for several weeks until he recovered strength, but one note I hid upstairs under his pillow, \"Dad, if you have found this note, you must be feeling better. We are so glad!\"\nJust like his medicine strengthened him physically, these \"emotional vitamins\" would improve his spiritual health. Several weeks later, in one of our regular phone calls, I asked Dad how he was doing. He said, \"Pretty good. I just found your note under my pillow upstairs!\"", "id": "high10802.txt"}
