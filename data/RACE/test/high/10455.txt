David was quick at connecting the shape of things to their words.\nWhen my son was about four years old, I walked with him to the backyard. I knew that there was an ant colony under one of the slate stones in the walkway near the shed, so I said to David, \"Come on. I want to show you something. \"\nAs I showed David the ants that were crawling around the slate stone, he crouched down on his legs and looked with great intensity at the ants.\nFor days after that, David wanted to look under every rock in the garden, and we often found worms, ants and so on. I recognized that David loved to look at things closely and observe how things moved, and so I continued to point things out to him as he grew older: planes, cars, shells etc. . David was a keen observer, and I just gave him the suggestions as to where to look.\nToday David is a medical doctor at Columbia University Center. I did not know that David would someday be a doctor, someone who has to pay close attention to what he sees, and yet I felt compelled when he was a boy to encourage his enthusiasm for observation.\nThat is what teachers and parents do: encourage a child's enthusiasm for a particular interest: music, swimming, art, reading. And we provide tools for the children. If a child likes to draw, give him brushes, pens, and paper. If a girl likes to tap on the table top, give her a drum. If a child wants to sing, give him a microphone and a Frank Sinatra recording.", "id": "high10455.txt"}
