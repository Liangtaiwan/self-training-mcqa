The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group established by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program, reports that the average surface temperature of the earth has increased during the twentieth century by 0.6deg _ 0.2degC.(The _ 0.2degC means that the increase might be as small as 0.4degC or as great as 0.8degC). This may seem like a small shift, but although regional and short--term temperatures do fluctuate  over a wide range, global temperatures are generally quite stable. In fact, the difference between today's average global temperature and the average global temperature during the last Ice Age is only about 5 degrees C. Indeed, it's warmer today around the world than at any time during the past 1,000years, and the warmest years of the previous century have occurred within the past decade.\nWe also know that human activities--primarily the burning of fossil fuels--have increased the greenhouse gas content of the earth's atmosphere significantly over the same period. Carbon dioxide is one of the most important greenhouse gases, which trap heat near the planet's surface.\nThe vast majority of climate researchers agree with these overall findings. The scientific disagreements that do still exist primarily concern detailed aspects of the processes that make up these largely accepted general themes.\nYou can think of this website as a window into the world of scientific research. In this primer, you'll find a general discussion of the physical processes underlying the earth's climate, an outline of the kinds of data that may shed light on how the climate is changing--and the role of human activity in these changes--and a description a some of the questions and uncertainties that researchers continue to explore. This primer is organized into four interconnected sections: the Atmosphere; the Hydrosphere ; the Cryosphere ; and the Biosphere .", "id": "high9639.txt"}
