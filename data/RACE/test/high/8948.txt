Memorizing phone numbers\nIt was annoying to remember numbers. Now we simply add them to our contacts list. That usually works well unless our device is lost,stolen,or damaged. No one can be expected to remember all their contact numbers. What we can do is memorize 5 of our most important contact numbers. This should include a mixture of family,friends and business. If you're really ambitious you can memorize 5 contacts for each category.\n2. Map-reading skills\nThe convenience and effectiveness of GPS guidance systems and digital maps generated by search engines is unquestionable. They've definitely made our lives easier. What we don't get from using these devices and applications is the increased ability to understand spatial orientation and navigation.\nTo renew or acquire those skills,try using physical maps to plan your next trip. After a few trips,you'll be pleasantly surprised with how useful a physical map can be.\n3. Photography\nEven amateur photography requires a basic learning about lighting,depth,and composition. This is true for digital photography. Most smart cameras automatically make these adjustments. We no longer have to learn the art of photography. On most devices,this is easily changed by turning off the automatic settings. Experiment with setting by hand the scene modes,lighting,and zoom. You just may learn that you're a \"true photographer\".\n4. Reading comprehension\nThe primary cause is E-reader. They're convenient and can store thousands of books. But there's evidence that E-reader makes it more difficult for readers to keep and recall information they just read. Don't worry! What we should do is make an effort to read printed books. This will be especially helpful when seeking information we need for academic or career purposes.\n5.Hand-written correspondence \nWriting letters and notes include hand writing skills,organizational skills,and learning about the person or persons you correspond with. This is another easily regained skill. Send a letter to an old friend,relative or acquaintance.", "id": "high8948.txt"}
