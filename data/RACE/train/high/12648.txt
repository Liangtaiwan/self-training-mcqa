What if I get sick?\"\nHer fears, as fears often are, turned out to be unfounded.\"The people were so supportive and loving,\" said Miya.\"I felt like I was part of the family.\"\nMiya's host family had a large network of cousins who all lived within shouting distance. The family would cook together, and at night would go dancing, talk or eat ice cream.She noted that the World Endeavors staff on location--Diego and Mercedes, and Mercedes' husband and daughter -were particularly helpful, taking her right to her neighborhood from the airport, and checking up periodically to make sure everything was going well.\nWhile her nights were spent dancing, cooking, and talking with her host family, Miya's days were occupied with the children of her host city.\"I would teach in the morning, and work in the orphanage in the afternoon,\" said Miya, whose placements were within walking distance from her host family.While the children were a lot of work, Miya felt a strong connection to the kids in the orphanage.\nMiya noted that Costa Rica is one of the more developed countries in Central America. A nearby Internet cafe, for example, helped her to stay in touch with her family while she was away.And now, back in the United States, the Internet helps her keep in touch with her host family.Their correspondence continues in Spanish.And her host parents, Rosario and Jorge, recently sent Miya a Christmas card through the mail.\nBack at school, Miya continues to pursue her instinct to improve education through volunteering. She participates in a mentoring group and works on a community health education program for high school students.Her time in Costa Rica, she says, \"fits right into my interests in global health.\"", "id": "high12648.txt"}
