We moved here from New York City, so I am accustomed  to reading excellent newspapers such asThe New York Times . In fact, we still havethe Timesdelivered on Sundays. The entire family enjoys reading the recipes  in the magazine, as well as the Styles section.\nThe Times is great, butthe Gazetteis another story. I've never read an article that doesn't contain at least three or four spelling or grammatical errors. For instance, in last week's issue you misspelled the word \"secretary\", used a singular verb with a plural noun, and used \"it's\" as a possessive  . And that was just in the lead story! In case you never went to elementary school, \"it's\" means \"it is \".It's also a possessive adjective!\nIt's a pity that this tiny little hick  town has only one newspaper, because I'd like to have an alternative  to the rag you publish. I find it hard to believe your news stories. If you can't spell correctly. How can you get your facts right?\nI've been meaning to get this off my chest for some time. Please cancel my subscription . And buy yourself a dictionary.\nSincerely,\nJane Z, Jones", "id": "high10791.txt"}
