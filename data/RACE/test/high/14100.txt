Recent in-depth analyses of the songs sung by humpback whales show that, even when their organ would allow them to do otherwise, the animals _ the same choices relating to sounds and beauty, and accept the same laws of song composition as those preferred by human musicians, and human ears, everywhere.\nFor example, male humpback whales, who spend six months of each year doing little else but singing, use rhythms   similar to those found in human music and musical phrases of similar length--a few seconds. Whales are able to make sounds over a range of at least seven octaves  , yet they tend to move on through a song in beautiful musical intervals, rather than moving forwards madly. They mix the sounds like drums and pure tones in a ratio   which agrees with that heard in much western music. They also use a favorite technique of human singers, the so-called A-B-A form, in which a theme is stated, then developed, and then returned to in slightly revised form.\nPerhaps most impressive, humpback songs contain tunes that rhyme. \"This suggests that whales use rhyme in the same way we do: as a technique in poem to help them remember complex material,\" the researchers write.", "id": "high14100.txt"}
