In 1950, he and two other men developed the teleprompter. One co-worker, Fred Barton, was an actor. He had an idea for a tool that would help television actors read their lines without having to memorize them. The other co-worker was Irving Kahn. He worked as vice-president of radio and television at 20thCentury Fox.\nThe first teleprompter involved a person who held a long piece of paper printed with big letters. As the actor read the lines, another person would move the paper ahead on the device . The teleprompter was first used on a television program called \"The First Hundred Years.\" Later versions used television screens to show the words that were to be read.\nHub Schlafly and his co-workers believed that many companies would want to buy the teleprompter. So, they left their jobs and created the TelePrompTer Corporation to sell their invention.\nIn 1952, former President Herbert Hoover became the first politician to use a teleprompter. The former president was speaking at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, USA. For a brief time, he stopped reading and began to talk about a subject not written in his speech. When Hoover wanted to continue the speech, the words on the teleprompter were not moving. He then said the machine should be restarted and viewers became aware of the new invention. Many reporters wrote about that incident, creating a new level of publicity for the teleprompter.\nSoon more and more politicians started to use it to face the television camera while reading prepared statements, instead of looking down at their notes. Then the device was used for almost all live television broadcasts.", "id": "high21712.txt"}
