Monday has traditionally been thought of as the most depressing day of the week but according to psychologists, midweek gives more cause for concern in reality. Wednesday represented the lowest point in the week as people were furthest away from the weekend that has either just gone or is coming up and often feel too tired to go on with work.\nHowever, psychologists have found that, on average, people's moods remain about the same on each day throughout the week.\nTo start their research, the University of Sydney scientists asked around 200 people what they thought their mood would be on each day of the week.\nMost said their worst moods were on Monday mornings and evenings but they became increasingly cheerful as the week went on, with their best moods falling on Friday and Saturday mornings and evenings.\nWhen asked why they believed that Friday and Saturday were best, respondents said they saw them as less-structured days when they could choose how to spend their time.\nThe psychologists then asked a further 350 people how they felt each day.\nThey found that, on average, people's moods remained about the same on each day throughout the week.Mondays were not as depressing as they had feared and Fridays and Saturdays were not as exciting as predicted.\nProfessor Charles Areni, who led the study, said the day-of-the-week stereotypes   stem from a cultural belief that people are generally happier when they are free to choose their activities compared to when they are engaged in paid work.\nIn reality, he said, weekends do not often see moods change because they are frequently dominated by productive activities that may require large amounts of energy and begin to feel tired like work. \"Day-of-the-week stereotypes like Monday morning blues and Thank God It's Friday are largely illusions,\" he said.", "id": "high11119.txt"}
