He saw a lion looking weak and tired, and asked, \"What is the matter, King of the Jungle?\"\nThe lion told the jackal his story. The jackal felt sorry for the lion. He pulled and pulled at the lion's tail until the lion became free. The lion was very happy and said, \"Thank you so much for helping me. I thought I would die! You are my friend for life! I would like you to come and live with me. From now on, I will hunt and share my food with you.\"\nThe jackal moved in with the lion's family and had a wonderful time.\nSoon, the lion had children of his own and so did the jackal. The lioness was not happy about the friendship. She complained to her children. Her children complained to the jackal's children; the jackal's children complained to their mother and their mother complained to the jackal.\nThe jackal was upset and told the lion, \"You told me to live with you. If you don't like it any more, you should have said so yourself.\" The lion was shocked and said, \"This is not true. I've never complained about you. I still want you to continue staying with me.\"\nThe jackal said, \"We understand each other. But our families don't. Perhaps it is better for us to live apart, but continue meeting each other when we are free. We can even hunt together!\"\nThe two families parted, but the lion and the jackal met often and remained friends for the rest of their lives.\nFrom the above paragraphs, we can conclude that in order to keep our good friendship, we have to give something up or give in in some particular cases. However, we can never give up or destroy our families. What do you think of it?", "id": "high10166.txt"}
