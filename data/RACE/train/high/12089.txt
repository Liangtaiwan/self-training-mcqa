As a child, he was slow to learn to talk. As a pupil, he was backward. But when he was fourteen years old, he became clever. He taught himself maths from textbooks. He studied hard because he wanted to be a physicist.\nIn 1901, Einstein began teaching. In 1902 he continued his studies at the University of Zurich. Several years later, he formulated his famous Theory of Relativity .To most people the law of relativity is difficult to explain. But once Einstein explained it very well to a group of young students. He said, \"When you sit with a good girl for two hours, you think it is only a minute. But when you sit on a hot stove for a minute, you think it's two hours. That is relativity.\"\nAfter Hitler came into power in Germany, Einstein went to America. In 1940 Einstein became an American citizen. In 1955, Einstein's life ended at the age of seventy-six.", "id": "high12089.txt"}
