Some people actually need it as they cannot do their jobs without it, and others simply feel they need it as they cannot imagine life without it.\nTo think that something that did not even exist 50 years ago has come to _ our lives like this in just about 15 years makes one wonder - just what will the future bring?\nIn 2004, a survey was conducted in the US asking a group of technology experts their opinions on the Internet in the next ten years. 57% of them agreed that virtual classes will be more widely adopted in schools, allowing students to learn with those at the same level and with interests in the same subjects. It's quite possible that, by the year 2030, every child in every school will do all their schoolwork on their own laptop with all their textbooks available on the Internet. No more heavy books to carry around and no more pens and paper!\nAt work, we already use email to deal with people both inside and outside our offices and video conferencing  is occurring more frequently. This means that meetings can be held between offices in different countries without the trouble caused by business travel. Business travel will not exist in the future, and so will offices as people all start to work from home.\nIt has also become a trend for people to use pocket computers such as Blackberries. With this helpful equipment, people can send and receive emails, surf the Web, and read multimedia files from absolutely anywhere even if we are on a beach holiday.\nThe Internet will have a revolutionary effect on entertainment in the future. Already we can buy and download music and movies from the Internet but it is still possible for us to buy a CD or go to the DVD stores to rent the latest movies. However, it's quite possible that in the future, CD shops and DVD rental stores will close and cinemas will no longer exist. Entertainment will become completely virtual although hopefully people will still want to get outside to play sports and entertain themselves in more healthy ways.\nWith the Internet we need only relax in the rocking chair. The Internet, however, has problems to be solved.", "id": "high6971.txt"}
