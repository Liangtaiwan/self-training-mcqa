Hi there! How are you doing today? I was hanging out with my friend earlier today. I am looking for a guy in a blue shirt and blue pants. Have you seen him? I cannot find him, and I thought I looked everywhere. I have checked behind the green couch and he was not there. I looked inside the white refrigerator and he was not there either. I looked to the left and looked to the right of the television and he was not in those places either!

Where would you look for someone? Where would you look in their house? I think he could be in one of the other rooms here. I checked in the living room and it was empty.

Wait, what's that? You said you saw someone in the kitchen? What were they wearing? Were they wearing a blue shirt? Oh they weren't? I think that could still be my friend! I'll head over to the kitchen, you can follow if you want. There's my friend! And he's wearing an orange shirt now; he must have left to change his shirt. Thank you so much!

The red fox slowly walked out of his den he lives in; his own house in the ground. His eyes bounced side to side as he made sure the coast was clear, then he ran down the path of autumn leaves. As he reached the end there was a an apple tree without leaves, but still one shiny red colored apple hung from a branch. He climbed up a nearby rock and took a running start towards the branch, jumping and barely grabbing on.

As she was playing with her favorite ball, Tori saw an opening in the fence.  Excited, she ran over to the fence and squeezed out.  She had never been on the street by herself before.  Tori ran down the sidewalk, and happily barked at all the other dogs she passed.  She loved to wag her tail in the summer breeze and was having a great time.  

All of a sudden, Tori was picked up by Ben and Mike, and thrown into a truck.  She was lost and confused.  Poor Tori didn't know what to do!  The truck pulled up to a building with a big sign that said "Animal Control".  Tori knew this was the place that people keep animals who are lost on the street.  Once the workers took her inside, they put her into a cage.  She was scared that Patty wouldn't know where to find her, but she knew Patty's phone number was on her collar.  She barked and barked to get the worker's attention, but no one seemed to pay her any attention.  

After two long hours, a tall man, named Joe, opened up her cage and looked at the charm on her collar.  He smiled at Tori and gave her a pat on the head.  Patty was there quickly, and gave Tori a big hug.  She was so happy to see her puppy again.

Tori learned to never escape the backyard again and lived happily ever after with Patty.

One day John and Sally's mother made up her mind to bake a very special cake for her son and daughter, but she didn't have the ingredients. She told John and Sally to go to the grocer's to buy the things she would need.

"I'll need some popcorn, a pea, some melon balls, and a cup of yogurt. I'm going to make a very special cake today," she said.

"Wow, that sounds horrible," said John.

"Yeah, we'd rather watch TV and eat potato chips," said Sally.

"Don't talk back, kids. Do what I said and head into town. It's a beautiful day. Go the long way and follow the river until you get there. Don't take the short way through the forest. A lion has escaped from the zoo. He might be hiding in the forest."

So John and Sally started the walk into town, but because they were disobedient children, they didn't follow the river like their mother told them. Instead they took the short way through the forest.

"I'm not afraid of a lion in the forest," said John. "Besides, I think mom has been eating too many melon balls and is letting her imagination get away from her again. If there were a lion in the forest, we would know about it."

So they wandered along the forest path, jumping in mud puddles and throwing sticks at one another. But as soon as John and Sally were in the darkest part of the forest, they heard a terrible roar. It was the lion! Horrified, they ran for their lives out of the forest, all the way back home.

"We're sorry!" they both said to their mother. "We'll never be disobedient again!"

One day a young mouse was out taking a walk to collect some berries. It was a nice day out, so the mouse chose to go down by the river to take a quick rest for a bit. When the mouse arrived at the river he found the perfect spot to rest. It was a small little area with soft sand to lie on, under a tree that gave a bit of shade. The mouse then sat back. After a little bit of time the mouse was fast asleep. 

Not long after the mouse had fallen asleep, the cat caught a scent in the air of the young mouse. The cat walked slowly up to the spot where the mouse was sleeping and licked his lips. Right when the cat was about to catch the mouse, the mouse woke up.

"What are you doing?!" asked the mouse in surprise. 

"I am trying to find dinner," said the cat. 

The mouse smiled. "I collected extra berries today on my walk. Would you like to have some?"

The cat was confused. He had never been given such a kind thing. "Well, OK. Berries are not my favorite, but I guess that they are OK." 

The cat and mouse then sat down together and ate a meal of tasty berries. It turned out that the cat was not so terrible after all-but had never been given kindness.

Sherry went out her back door and put on her sunglasses, large hat and heavy cloth work gloves.  She knelt in front of her small garden and started to pull weeds, throwing each in a small trashcan nearby.  As she worked she listened to the sounds of her neighbor's boys, Sam and Carl, playing. Sometimes she stopped long enough to sip from her bottle of water.

Her work and the heat of the day tired her out quickly, so she put her gardening tools away, dumped the weeds into the larger bin, and went back into her house to cool down and do some of the other items on her to-do list.  She chose to do laundry so she could sit and read as the washer and dryer ran.  Eventually the laundry was finished washing and drying, so she folded the laundry and put it away.

The birds chirped, the sun beat down on a nearby window, and the noisy sound of an alarm clock tried to let me know it was seven in the morning. Not only that, but the sound of a high pitched voice, announcing "It's here! It's here Janet, it's here!" That voice belonged to my sister, Karen. What she meant was that the day had finally come for our family trip to the nearby beach located beyond Eagle Point. She got our parents out of bed way before they were ready to be up, but they knew how much it meant to her so they put a smile on as mother made breakfast and father packed the family car with towels and umbrellas. We could barely hear him say how there wasn't much room for many items, but he fit it all together like every year. I warned him last go around to get something larger like a truck, or a van, even joking an airplane, but he stuck to his guns and stayed with cars.

Truthfully, I had forgotten about the trip and made plans with my friends, Lauren and Matthew. As sad as I was to have to back out, I called the two of them and let them know of my mistake. They understood, and soon after we all entered the car and went on our way to the beach. The ride and the actual activities were pretty fun!

Once there was a white horse named Bob, who lived in a house with his best friend. His friend was a cat named Shelly who loved to play baseball. The two of them would go to the park and play baseball with Lucy a lamb who lived next door. 

It was Friday morning and Bob and Shelly were in the park waiting for Lucy. She was late and when she finally showed up she had forgotten the ball. 

"What can we use for a ball?" Bob asked. 
They looked around. There were rocks but they were too hard. There could get mud out of the pond but that would be too soft and splat when they hit it with the wooden bat. Finally Bob, being the tallest, saw that in a pile of plants that there were melons growing. 
"Let's use a melon," Bob said.
"That's stupid," said Shelly, the practical one.
"No hear him out," said Lucy. "It might work.
"It'll work," said Bob, and he picked a melon and handed it to Shelly. "You pitch."
"This is going to end badly, I'm afraid," Shelly said, throwing the melon at Bob who stood over home plate.
"I know what I'm doing," Bob said, swinging the bat as hard as he could. When the bat hit the melon it splatted into a million pieces, raining sticky pieces down on Bob and Shelly and Lucy and a wedding party that had been setting up nearby.

I was really scared walking into school today. It was the first day of sixth grade and I was excited to be leaving elementary school, but I ended up going to a different middle school than all my friends since I moved across town last year. My name is Matt, but I'm going to try and not let anyone else know that as I'd rather sit in the back and keep to myself. I didn't want to ride the bus, so my mom said she would drive me there for today. Thankfully I found my classroom, but I walked in and saw nobody I knew, as I thought. I took a seat at an empty table as the teacher, Mrs. Frank took roll call. She seemed nice, and I'm happy we weren't told to sit in alphabetical order or by boys to boys and girls to girls, as I was free to sit by myself for now. Mrs. Frank called out Jimmy, Sally, Linda, Jason, and then finally got to my name in which I raised my hand quickly. As soon as she was done, a few of the kids who arrived late came to sit by me and said their names were Martin and Mark.

Martin said he liked how our names all sounded the same, and Mark seconded that as we started talking before class began. When it was time to eat, we all said we would sit with one another in the lunch room, and also when it came to recess and playing together. It was nice to have some friends after being so nervous earlier, and see that everything does work out in the end. Hopefully soon we can all play together outside of class, but as far as today, it was a great start!

A man sailed out to sea in a small boat. The sun was only rising, but this man liked spending all day fishing. A long way away from the shore, he stopped his boat. He pulled out his fishing pole and put some worms on the hook. He held it in the deep water and waited for a long time. After three hours there was still not a bite. The sun moved slowly across the sky. Morning turned into afternoon, and afternoon to evening. It was a slow day of fishing and he had to pack up. A fisherman does not give up so easy, even after many hours. It takes time to catch fish and fishing is not for people who give up quickly. The fisherman went home empty handed.

One day, a boy named Sam went to the doctor because he fell and hurt his knee. He was riding his green tricycle in the yard when it happened. He played with yellow and red blocks in the waiting room before his visit with the doctor. His mother was sitting in a chair, reading a magazine and talking to other mothers sitting around her. The friendly nurse called Sam from the waiting room to finally visit the doctor. The nurse weighed Sam, measured his height, and asked him questions about the foods he had eaten that day.

On the way out of the doctor's office, Sam took a purple lollipop to eat on the car ride home. Sam's mom drove him back home, telling him to be careful for the next time that he plays outside.

Dr. Curtis

On a small farm outside of town, lived a boy named Curtis. Curtis was seven years old and he wanted to become an animal doctor someday. He always loved animals and helped take care of them on his family's farm.

Curtis liked to feed the horses, chickens, pigs, dogs, and the cat. He also like to help take care of them when they got hurt or sick. Once, Curtis stayed in the barn all night, helping his father with a sick pony. The animal doctor was there too, and Curtis watched everything that he did. The doctor had to keep giving Bonnie the pony some medicine. And he kept checking her eyes and mouth.

When the pony got better, the animal doctor went home. But Curtis and his father stayed in the barn with the pony until it became light outside. Curtis had gone to sleep, so his father carried him to their house and put him to bed.

Curtis was so tired that even the smell of bacon from the kitchen didn't wake him up. Later, his father came and woke him. "Bonnie is going to be alright," he said to Curtis.

"Really?" the boy said as he rubbed his eyes, "I got to go check on her." 

"That can wait. Right now you need to eat something. I saved you some bacon, Mr. sleepy head," his father said as he smiled at Curtis.

Curtis washed, dressed, and ate as fast as he could and then raced to the barn. He stood on a stool and looked into Bonnie's eyes and mouth. He put his head on her chest and listened to her heart. Then he checked her legs and tail. He tried to do everything the animal doctor did and more.

Curtis saw his father standing at the door and said, "Everything looks okay, daddy. I think she can go out to the big tree with the other horses."

There is a large tree in a park where all the kids in the neighborhood can hang out and play.  The tree was planted in 1896 and has grown to over fifty feet tall with branches that were another thirty feet wide.  Next to the tree is a jungle gym.  The jungle gym has two slides, a fireman pole, a rock climbing wall, and much more.  One day the kids in the neighborhood came up with the idea of building a tree house so they could spend all of their time at the park, even when it was raining outside.  The children all went to their parents begging them to help and get wood.  The families of the neighborhood began building the master tree house.  Upon completion the tree house was ten by twelve feet high, with two windows, and plenty of space for the children to have fun.  Every day during the summer that year the children played in the park and went in the tree house from sunrise to sunset every day.  Fifteen years have gone by and the children are now too old to use the tree house.  The tree house still sits on the tree but instead has a new group of kids that get to enjoy the house.  Now the first kids have become parents and get to watch their idea live on and make the children of the neighborhood happy.

Jane was a dog who lived all alone, in a broken freezer in a dump. There was all kinds of junk in the dump, from a car, to a wooden cow, to a clock, but Jane's favorite thing she had was a giant sock. Jane was always chewing at the sock, and kept it with her in her freezer. When Jane was not chewing on the sock, she was running around in the dump, looking for things to eat, or things that were fun to sniff, or that she could bark at. Still, even when Jane was having fun doing other things, her favorite thing of all to do was chew on her giant sock. Sometimes Jane would see other animals in the dump. There were always birds around, as well as sometimes a snake, and once even a cat. A deer even came through once. Jane was quick to start barking at the cat, and she quickly scared it away and it never came back. The birds were something that Jane was always trying to catch.

There was once a frog who lived all the way in the North Pole. His name was Isaac. He worked at Santa's factory, baking cakes with lots of frosting. He didn't like making cake much. In fact, Isaac's dream was to work in the factory with the elves making toys. But since he was a frog, he was never allowed to build toys with the elves. One day, he got a smart idea. He would dress up as an elf and sneak into the factory, hoping no one would find out. So he got a hold of an elf costume and put it on. He put on the elf hat, the elf shirt, and the elf shoes. He really looked like an elf! So one day, when the factory was opening for the morning, Isaac snuck in line with the rest of the elves and tried to get into the factory. Luckily, it worked, and no one found out! Isaac was filled with joy as he had never seen the inside of the toy factory before. It was huge, and there were thousands of elves building toys for the children for next Christmas. He joined them in building, and for a long time, no one knew he was a frog. That is, until one elf, named Joe, saw that there was something weird about Isaac. He didn't look like the rest of the elves. So he kept his eye on Isaac, waiting to see what his secret was. One day, Isaac slipped, and his hat fell off. When this happened, Joe saw that he was a frog, and not an elf! He told Isaac that he would tell Santa all about how he had snuck in. Isaac begged Joe not to tell. Joe wanted to know what was in it for him, so Isaac promised to bake him a cake with lots of frosting. Joe never told.

Millie thought she would like to stop eating meat, but she didn't know if she could do it.  Once, when she was younger, she had tried to go without eating meat, but before the first day was over, her stomach had felt a little empty.  "Hmm," she had thought.  "Maybe it's not good for me to stop eating meat.  Maybe that's why I feel so hungry."

But, now, she wondered if there was anything she could do so she wouldn't feel so hungry, even if she did stop eating meat.

She went to the library, and there, she saw a magazine.  Below the title, the cover said, "Learn to live on vegetables!"  She read in the magazine that it was good to change her meal plan slowly.  If she really felt hungry for a little meat, the magazine said, it was okay to have some, and then go back to eating her veggies.

She also read that beans could give her body a lot of the same things meat could, but that eating things like rice and noodles would help the beans do a better job of building her body and giving it energy.  That way, she would feel better, instead of feeling so hungry!

Millie wasn't sure if it would work this time, but the magazine's tips made her want to give it another try!

1: multiple: What did she read about in the magazine?

 B) Because she gave it another try.

Finally, his parents told him that he could have a goldfish if he found it himself. With that, Boo set out to look for a goldfish.  First he looked under his pillow.  No goldfish there.

"Last," said Miles, "You must fold my laundry.  It is behind the wood pile."  Boo quickly set to work folding the laundry.  When he was all done he returned to Miles.

"Miles," he asked, "Where can I find a goldfish?"

Miles smiled as he spoke, "Fish swim, yes?  Look in a place with water."

The teacher was writing on the chalkboard as she spoke.  She was very happy to be teaching the children more vocabulary words to use.  Then they could read more books.

I once was the leader of running a skills camp for a Boy Scout group. The weekend long camp included a lot of different games. One of the games was for fire-building. The point of the game was to help teach campers how to best build fires. There are many different ways you can build a campfire. You can build a lean-to campfire. You can also build a teepee fire. To build the fires you must find and sort different sizes of sticks and brush and larger logs to get the fire going. The goal of the game is to build a fire big enough to burn a string that is hanging a few feet above the ground. My group was falling behind, so I gave the idea of throwing a bunch of leaves on the fire all at once to make a huge fire to quickly burn the string. We were not allowed to win the game because it was said we cheated.

One morning, Billy was giving some milk to his lamb, Beverly. He heard a noise coming from a nearby rock. He went to see what was making the sound, and Beverly followed him. He looked around the rock, but couldn't see anything. Billy tried to lift the rock with a stick, to see what was under it, but it was too heavy. 

"I wonder what's making that noise," Billy said. Beverly ate some grass. He went back home. Beverly followed him.

Billy asked his wife, Judy, if she had anything that could lift the rock. She looked around the kitchen and found a spoon and a towel. "Use the spoon to dig under the rock," she said. "Then you can put the towel under the rock, and pull it towards you."

"That's a good idea," Billy said. He dug under the rock with the spoon. Then he tried to pull it towards him with the towel, but it was too heavy.

Then Beverly, the lamb, started pushing the rock with her forehead. At first, the rock only rolled around in its hole. Then, when Billy pulled and Beverly pushed at the same time, it rolled downhill.

"Thank you, Beverly," Billy said. "I couldn't have done it without you."

The room had a high ceiling and white walls. The lunch was in the center of the room on a stand. The hamster was the first to see the lunch and ran over to it. "What a delicious lunch," he said, "I wish there was something for me to eat it with!"

In a big forest lived a fox named Manny. He was having a fun morning. Dad had given him a cookie as a snack and it was yummy! Now he was wandering through the woods, looking for an adventure. After a little bit he came across a frog sitting on a log. They looked at each other, but did not say anything. Manny spoke first. "Hi there, my name is Manny and I'm a fox. Who are you?"
