He believes he's the best parent in the world. Some days ago, Xiao Baiyou's latest book about how to be a successful parent came out. He is pretty strict with his four children. Sometimes he even beat them. But the children don't hate their daddy at all. And all of them finally went to Pecking University, one of the top universities in China. So Xiao proudly tells others about his education idea that children need strict rules. In his microblog, he said, \"Come on, want your children to enter Peking University without rules? You must be joking.\" And, \"Leave your children more money, and strict rules at the same time.\"But the \"Wolf Daddy\" way was soon questioned by other parents. Some say that Xiao Baiyou just want to be famous by doing so. The \"Wolf Daddy\" Xiao Baiyou is a 47-year-old Guangdong businessman who deals in luxury goods  in Hong Kong. Unlike many other parents who usually have one child, Xiao has four children. Two of them were born in Hong Kong and two in the US. Some people on the Internet think the reason why his children were able to enter Peking University is because the exam is much easier taken from Hong Kong.", "id": "middle3524.txt"}
