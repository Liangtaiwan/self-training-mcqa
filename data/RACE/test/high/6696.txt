Her father and uncle often talk about the problems surrounding this group of people. However, Shi cares more about the children of these migrant workers.\nLast year Shi's housekeeper's daughter had to give up her schooling in Beijing because she would not be allowed to sit the national college entrance exam. She was forced to continue her high school education in her hometown in Sichuan Province.\nShi thinks the current law is unfair for migrant workers' children, as it prevents them from studying at public schools, unless their parents pay huge sums. So, Shi decided to do a survey of migrant workers so that she could find some solutions to help solve the problem.\nIn the last six months Shi spoke to 186 migrant workers in Beijing. Her interviewees include babysitters, guards, keepers, supermarket clerks, house cleaners and construction site workers. Shi found out that 55 of them were parents. Among this group, only eight have children who attend schools in Beijing. The other 47 had to leave children with relatives in the countryside. However, 40 of the 47 would like to enroll  their children in city schools.\nFrom her interviews, Shi found that the workers' lowest income was 400 yuan each month. Over one-third earn a monthly wage of or below 1000 yuan. \"Even schools for migrant workers' children charge more than public schools. Morever, parents constantly worry about these schools closing or relocating,\" she explained.\nShi has recently completed a report about her survey, in which she makes a series of recommendations. \"The government can set up public schools for migrants' children equal to schools for city children. Second, to offset  migrant workers' very low pay, public schools should offer them special rates so they can afford their children's tuition .", "id": "high6696.txt"}
