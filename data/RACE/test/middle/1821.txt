You don't need to worry about people who have beautiful houses with large gardens and swimming pools or those who have nice cars and a lot of money and so on. Why? Because those who have big houses may often feel lonely and those who have cars may want to walk on the country roads in their free time.\nIn fact, happiness is always around you if you put your heart into it. When you are in trouble at school, your friends will help you; when you are studying hard at your lessons, your parents are always taking good care of you; When you get success, your friends will say congratulations to you; When you do something wrong, people around you will help you to correct it. All your happiness is always around you.\nHappiness is not the same as money. It is a feeling of your heart. When you are poor, you can also say you are very happy, because you have something else that can't be bought with money. When you meet with difficulties, you can say loudly you are very happy, because you have more chances to challenge yourself. So you should not always say you are poor and you have bad luck. As the saying goes, life is like a revolving  door. When it closes, it also opens. If you take every chance you get, you can be a happy and lucky person.\n,. (5,2,10)", "id": "middle1821.txt"}
