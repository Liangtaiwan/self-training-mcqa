Because of this, quarrels began in my family with each trouble brought about by her diagnosis. My husband became more and more unfriendly toward me and toward Simona. He didn't understand how important it was for Simona to receive regular examinations by a doctor or why she needed proper treatment for her sickness.\"\nWhen her mother tried to enroll  Simona in a school, the teacher warned her that when other parents found out about her illness she would be shunned by the other children.\nSimona's mother looked for help and found a social worker from the Community Resource Center. The social worker helped her enroll Simona in another school and provided emotional, financial, and material support for the family. Simona's parents were able to ease the tension in the family. Her mother also now attends parenting classes and support groups at the Center.\nThe Community Resource Center provides not only many needed resources, but also a place where women can gain skills and self-confidence.
