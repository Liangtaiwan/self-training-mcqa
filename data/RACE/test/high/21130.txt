The making of conventional glass bottles and the corks   uses large quantities of natural resources and causes a lot of pollution.\nBeyond manufacturing, the transport of wine in glass bottles across the country and around the world also has its environmental effect. Trucking all the heavy glass bottles causes a much larger carbon footprint than the transportation of much lighter boxed wine. Almost half the weight of an ordinary case of wine comes from the bottles; about 95 percent of the weight of a case of boxed wine is the wine itself.\n\"A standard wine bottle holds 750 milliliters of wine and causes about 5.2 pounds of carbon dioxide when it travels from a farm in California to a store in New York,\" reports Colman, a researcher. \"A 3-liter box causes about half the carbon dioxide per 750 milliliters.\"\nAccording to the Wine Group, the third largest wine company in the world and a big advocate for switching away from glass bottles, there are other advantages to boxed wine (which typically includes a plastic bag within a cardboard box). The vacuum   packaging of boxed wine allows it to stay fresh for up to six weeks in the fridge once the seal is broken and the first glass has been poured.\nStill, despite the benefits, boxed wine may still be a tough pill to swallow for many wine experts. \"Even those traditionalists who are coming around to the idea that maybe screw caps   are fine for some wines, would not like the idea of a cellar   full of cardboard boxes,\" says wine writer Lee Asbell. \"It is difficult to imagine how wine service at fine-dining establishments would handle such a change.\" For now, boxed wine is still the field of cheaper brands. But that could all change as more and more wine makers and drinkers take responsibility for saving the Earth.", "id": "high21130.txt"}
