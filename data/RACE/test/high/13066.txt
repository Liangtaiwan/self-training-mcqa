What about Abraham Lincoln? Some government offices call it Presidents' Day.Others say the holiday is officially Washington's Birthday.Confused yet?\nGeorge Washington was elected the country's first President on April 30,1789.Soon after,Americans began publicly celebrating his birthday.Presidential historians say the actual date of George Washington's birth is February 11,1732.But a change in the calendar system 20 years later shifted all dates,making Washington's birthday February 22,which is now well accepted.In 1879.Congress made Washington's birthday an official federal holiday.It was the first federal holiday to celebrate an individual's birthday.In 1968,Congress passed the Monday Holidays Act,which moved the holiday to the third Monday in February.The new law did not change the holiday's name.It was still called Washington's Birthday,even though some lawmakers wanted to call it Presidents' Day to include Abraham Lincoln,whose actual birthday is February 12.\nMany people argue that the holiday should celebrate all past Presidents.They feel Lincoln should be honored for his role in preserving the nation during the Civil War and helping to free slaves.Others feel the holiday should only honor Washington.the country's first President.They say shifting the focus away from Washington would mean future generations of kids would not know about the Father of Our Country.\nLaws have been introduced in Congress over the years to require use of the term \"George Washington's Birthday.\"but none of those laws have been passed.Meanwhile,many state governments and school districts now use the term \"Presidents' Day.\"Many stoles also use it to promote holiday sales.\nShould the holiday honor Washington,Washington and Lincoln,or all past Presidents?
