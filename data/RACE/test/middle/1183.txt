A man called Walt Disney made a cartoon mouse. The cartoon mouse could talk in these films. He made his mouse become a good friend of both young people and old people. Children liked to see their lovely friend, because he brought happiness to them.\nMickey is a clean mouse right from the beginning. Maybe this is why people love Mickey Mouse very much. In his early life, Mickey did some wrong things. People were very angry. They wrote to Disney and said they didn't want Mickey to do the wrong things. Because there were some things that Mickey could not do. Disney made a new animal called Donald Duck. He also made a dog, Pluto. This dog does some foolish   and wrong things wherever he goes. Now, our Mickey Mouse is more interesting as well. He is known as a star of beauty and wisdom  . He has friends in almost every country.", "id": "middle1183.txt"}
