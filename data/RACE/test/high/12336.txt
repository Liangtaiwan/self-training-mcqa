But isn't it true of people? Can people change themselves? Are we humans just creatures of habits? Do we not have any control over our actions and habits?\nOne guy said, \"Bad habits are like a comfortable bed. They're easy to get into, but hard to get out of.\" Someone else said, \"The chains of habits are too small to feel until they're too strong to break.\" So breaking the mould of our bad habits takes effort.\nHabits are like the roads we take through our life every day. The problem is that not every road takes us where we need to go. Actually, our routes through life often become our ruts   in life. We end up stuck in them and find it hard to dig ourselves out. That's why we must change our bad habits as soon as possible before they become our second nature. You see, our habits become our character and our character becomes our life. As one wise person said, \"First we make our habits, and then our habits make us.\"\nBut we humans don't like to change. So we come up with excuses, like \"I can't be different; that's just the way I am.\" And the good excuse is \"You can't teach an old dog new tricks.\" But that's just it: we're not dogs or animals. In fact, we're the only creatures who have the freedom and power to change and choose the kind of person we want to become.", "id": "high12336.txt"}
