The population of the UK is about 63,000,000.\nLatest figures from Cancer Research UK show smoking is the biggest avoidable risk factor  , followed by unhealthy diets. The charity advises people to live healthily, limit alcohol intake and do regular exercise.\nAccording to the figures from 2007 to 2011, more than 300,000 cases of cancer recorded were linked to smoking. A further 145,000 were linked to unhealthy diets containing too much processed food. Obesity contributed to 88,000 cases and alcohol to 62,200. Sun damage to the skin and physical inactivity were also contributing factors.\nProfessor Max Parkin, a Cancer Research UK statistician, says, \"There's now little doubt that certain lifestyle choices can have a big influence on cancer risk, with research around the world all pointing to the same key risk factors.\"\n\"Of course everyone wants to enjoy some extra treats during the Christmas holidays so we don't want to ban beef pies and wine but it's a good time to think about taking up some healthy habits.\"\n\"Leading a healthy lifestyle can't guarantee someone won't get cancer but _ by taking positive steps.\"\nPublic Health England says a healthy lifestyle can play an important role in reducing cancer risk. It says campaigns such as Smokefree, Dry January and Change4Life Sugar Swaps all aim to raise public awareness. It's important that we not only continue to make progress in noticing cancer earlier and improving treatments, but helping people understand how they can reduce their risk of developing cancer in the first place remains important in dealing with cancer.", "id": "high13822.txt"}
