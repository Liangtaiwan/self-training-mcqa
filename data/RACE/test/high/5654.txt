He threw the paper in the bin and screamed.\nRichard started to recollect. He remembered that last night when he went to bed he had a chest pain and he was rushed to hospital. Then he went into a sound sleep. But what happened after that?\nHe could suddenly see his living room filled with people... all in tears; his mom, his wife and his children. He also saw his best friend, the one he had a serious misunderstanding a few days back. He wanted to say \"Sorry\" to him... but now no one could hear his voice.\nHe wondered how he could tell his mom that he felt so thankful to have her in his life! He wanted to tell his children how much he loved them.

He was on his bed; his wife lay beside him, deep in sleep. Richard whispered in her ears, \"You are the best thing to have ever happened to me!\"\nHe went up to the window, looking outside. Yes, everything was just the way he has been knowing so long. He decided to meet up his friends and clear all misunderstandings; he also decided to tell everyone who mattered to him all that has remained unsaid so far!", "id": "high5654.txt"}
