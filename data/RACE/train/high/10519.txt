I walked on and soon found the cause -- a little taxi that had got stuck in the middle of the road. There was sweat on the driver's face as he tried to start the engine again and again -- nothing happened. \"No petrol,\"\nI said to myself and then found myself getting angry. \"Why doesn't the fool move his taxi to the side?\" I thought, so did all the others who honked and shouted.\nHe got up tiredly, and the passenger in the taxi got out. He was a young man in a white shirt, who watched the driver try to push it to the side. \"Stupid guy!\" I said. \"Can't he lend a helping hand? \"\nI watched as the poor driver pushed it to the side. Cars, buses and trucks went past cursing ( ) the poor man.

How had I helped deal with the problem? Did I help the poor man push his taxi? I'd done my bit, with my mouth. But never had I moved to solve the problem. I was shocked with guilt as I heard him asking, \"Sir! Did you?\"", "id": "high10519.txt"}
