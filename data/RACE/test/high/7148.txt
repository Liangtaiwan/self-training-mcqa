So it is only reasonable that people shopping on the Net would be a little _ of the security levels.\nInternet giants such as Microsoft knew consumer confidence was the key to getting virtual shopping off the ground, and they work hard to make people feel safe to shop online.\nCredit card companies, too, quickly saw the potential for Internet shopping, and have installed things like online shopping insurance for people. If you ever have a problem with your online credit purchases, many credit card companies will happily refund  your money and then set their claws on the company that wronged you.
