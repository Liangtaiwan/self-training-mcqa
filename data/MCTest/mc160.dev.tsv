I was pulling\newlineweeds which is not my favorite job, but I was enjoying the day. I live by a lake so\newlinesometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake. It is so beautiful and it\newlinemakes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in\newlineor near the lake.\newline\newlineOn this day, I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. I got up from my garden\newlineand walked to the lake. I kept hearing this strange sound. It sounded like someone talking\newlinein a very low voice. I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of\newlinethe time. The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to "say" to\newlineother lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and\newlineshort. Then there is the "where are you" call which is long, slow and loud. But this sound\newlinewas not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot\newlineanything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totally\newlinegiven up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was it\newlinecoming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around to\newlinethe other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it is\newlinenot a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a father\newlinelake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat\newlinefish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to\newlineswim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour.
