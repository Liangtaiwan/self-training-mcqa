All of us go to school early. Our teachers are going to take us to Blue Sky Park. The park is near our school. We can go to the park on foot.\nBlue Sky Park is very beautiful. There are many trees, a football field, a big playground and a small lake in it. It's a sunny day today, but there are not many people in the park. Li Lei is sitting under the tree. Han Mei and Lu Lu are playing on the playground. A bird in the tree is watching them. Look at me. I am playing football with other boys. How happy we are! Where are Miss Fang and Mr. Wu? They are boating on the lake. All of us have a good time in the park. We want to visit it again.", "id": "middle3436.txt"}
