You may find a combination of these is a best choice for you.\nIf you can find a course in the language you want to learn in your country, this is quite a good way to study. A variety of courses are usually available, including part-time and full-time courses. If you look around, you can probably find a course that suits your needs.\nThe main advantage of such courses is that you'll have a teacher to provide you with instructions, support and with whom to practice your language. You will also be studying with others who are at more or less the same level and you can exchange ideas with them and help one another.\nOne choice is to study a language in a country where it's spoken. There are many schools teaching English, French, Spanish, Italian and German, but far fewer teaching other languages. The main advantage of studying abroad is that you are totally in the language, not just in class, but the rest of the time as well. As a result, you can make rapid progress.\nThe main disadvantage of studying abroad is the cost, not just of your course, but also of your food and travel. However, if you're a native speaker of English, you could get a job teaching English in a country where the language you want to learn is spoken.\nStudying online is also a good choice. There are plenty to choose from a lot of languages. Many are free but there are some you have to pay for. Some of the paid ones provide support from teachers via email, chat programs, video conferencing, telephone or even face to face.", "id": "high16395.txt"}
