He can think, learn and speak. Scientists once thought that men are different from animals because they can think and learn. They know that animals can learn--dogs, rats, birds can learn. So scientists are beginning to understand that men are different from animals because they can speak. Animals cannot speak. They make noises when they are afraid, or angry, or unhappy. Apes  can understand some things more quickly than human, one or two have learnt a few words. But they are still different from us. They cannot join words and make sentences; they cannot think like us because they have no language. They can never think about the past or the future.\nLanguage is a wonderful thing.
