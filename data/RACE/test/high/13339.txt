Even though autumn is approaching Australia's Brisbane in April, one can still watch colorful blooming   flowers in Julie's little garden, as she tells that in her community,\"Each of us has a beautiful yard. The whole community, from children to elderly people, takes care of the environment as if they are taking care of their own garden.\"\n\"Gardening is the most popular club in our community,\" she says. \"A lot of retired people don't just regularly organize gardening lectures, but also personally visit families in the community to provide gardening training. So you can see that flowers continue to blossom  in our gardens throughout the year.\"\nTalking about her people's sense of caring for the environment, Julie says when people in the community take along their dog, they always carry a garbage bag to deal with the dog's waste. \"In our community, you will never experience the embarrassment of stepping on the dirty waste while you are walking on the grass,\" says Julie with a smile. \"Taking care of the dog's waste can also help to develop children's sense of responsibility!\"\nAs to protecting water resources, the Australian government has made strict rules for families. Julie says, \"We certainly would not use tap water to water the flowers!\" She says almost every family in her community has a huge tank used to store rainwater, which is later used as the resource of all outdoor water use, including car washing and watering the garden. This year, they also asked people to connect the water tank with their toilets.", "id": "high13339.txt"}
