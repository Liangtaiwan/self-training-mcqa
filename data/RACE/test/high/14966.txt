As a result, about 300 million children around the world go barefoot. Those children risk picking up diseases and parasites from the soil.\nAn American man may have a solution for those barefoot kids -- a shoe that grows with the child. Kenton Lee is the creator of The Shoe That Grows. He explains how the shoe works and how it is able to last so long.\n\"It grows in three places: the front; it can also grow on the side with Velcro; and on the back with our buckle. It can last up to five years. The bottom is compressed rubber like tire rubber. The top is just high-quality leather.\" The shoe comes in two sizes: small that fits children aged 4 to 9 and large for children aged 9 to 14.\nLee says he got the idea for the shoe while working as a volunteer in an orphanage in Kenya. \"... and there was a little girl in a white dress walking next to me. And I just remember looking down and seeing how small her shoes were. They were just way too small for her feet. They were so small that she had to cut open the front of her shoes to let her toes stick out. And I just remember thinking, wouldn't it be nice if there were a pair of shoes that could grow with her feet?\"\nHowever, Lee says it was not easy to turn his idea into a reality. \"I kept writing down I should do this because of this or because of that. All these reasons why it really was important for me to try to make the shoes that could grow and try to help.\" Finally, in 2009 Lee founded a non-profit organization called Because International. In the office of Because International, Lee keeps a pair of his own shoes to help him remember his promise. \"I told myself I would not get new shoes until the idea was done. So, those are the shoes that I wore for a little over five years.\"", "id": "high14966.txt"}
