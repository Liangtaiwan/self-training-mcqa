The models have shining hair like jewels  . But now to make hair shine is no longer the task of hair care products, because hair can be made into real jewels. Believe it or not, a company called LifeGem in the US turns hair into jewels.\nThe company is in the business of taking hair from dead people and making it into diamonds  . The diamonds are for the families to remember the dead people.\nNow the company plans to make three diamonds using Beethoven's hair to show their latest technology  . The work will take about 7 months and in the end, Beethoven's long hair will become 3 shining diamonds between 0.5 to 1 carat  in size.\nSince the great musician died in 1827, you may wonder how they got Beethoven's hair. Actually, the hair was given by John Rezniloff, who holds the Guinness World Record for the largest and most valuable collection of celebrities'   hair. His collection also includes hair of Napoleon, Albert Einstein,  Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy. In total,  the collection is worth over 5 million dollars.\nThough it sounds unbelievable  , to have such diamonds made with hair may be a good way to show respect   and love to those who died.", "id": "middle549.txt"}
