She was so sure that Santa Claus would bring it to her.\" he said.\nI replied to him that maybe Santa Claus will bring it to her, and he shouldn't worry. But he replied to me sadly, \"No, Santa Claus can't bring it to her where she is now. I have to give the doll to my mommy so that she can give it to my sister when she goes there.\" His eyes were so sad while saying this. \"My sister has gone to be with God. Daddy says that Mommy is going to see God very soon too, so I thought that she could take the doll with her to give it to my sister.\" My heart nearly stopped. I quickly reached for my wallet and said to the boy, \"What if we checked again, just in case  you do have enough money?\"\n\"Ok,\" he said. \"I hope that I have enough.\" I added some of my money to his without letting him see and we started to count it. There was enough for the doll and even some spare money left . The little boy said, \"Thank you God for giving me enough money!\"\nI left the store, feeling as if my life had been changed forever.", "id": "middle1478.txt"}
