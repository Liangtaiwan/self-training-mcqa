There is only the massive Australian wild land, where some houses are 500 miles apart and some driveways are 50 miles long.\nThere seem to be only two main sources of entertainment out here: the sunset at the beach and Sun Pictures.\nSun Pictures is a very different movie theater:The seats are park benches and deck chairs, but you're also welcome to sit on the grass.\nIt is the world's oldest outdoor movie garden. Sun Pictures was built in 1916 on the other side of the globe from Hollywood. All the big films were shipped here and the lonely country was amazed.\nBroome resident Pearl Hamaguchi has never traveled far from home.
