I think I understand the life on earth now and I would like to give you my impressions.\nFirst of all you live in boxes. Every morning you leave your big boxes and get into smaller boxes on wheels. All these small boxes race around and around, and finally stop to rest. You then leave these boxes on wheels and go to very large tall boxes.\nAfter testing all days you get back in your little boxes and return to your big boxes. There you sit and stare at tiny glowing boxes with moving pictures on the front.\nOnly one thing puzzles me. One day I went to a football game. A bunch of angry boys fought over a little round ball. Everyone yelled for them to stop but they kept on fighting. They were angry, I suppose, about being cooped up  in boxes all day.\nThank you earthmen for this chance to get to know you.\n Gratefully,\nThe man from the Mars", "id": "high21220.txt"}
