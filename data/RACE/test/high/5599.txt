Judging by the survey data, many Chinese workplaces are black holes of misery and despair.\nOnly 6% of Chinese employees said they are \"engaged\" in their jobs, according to a global Gallup survey released this month. China's numbers equal the numbers out of war-weary  Iraq.\nWorkers across all income levels and industries were surveyed by Gallup in China, defined by Gallup to mean they were \"psychologically committed to their jobs and likely to be making positive contributions to their organizations\".\nOut of 94 countries polled, only six countries scored lower rates of job engagement than China, including Tunisia, Israel and Syria. Unsurprisingly, 0% of Syrians admitted to being engaged at work.\nIn a related survey, China ranked near the bottom in a poll measuring job satisfaction among 22 Asian countries. Only 49% of Chinese respondents said they were happy in their jobs.\nPart of the problem, I suspect, is that very few in China have the _ to pursue a career that truly interests them.\nEven university graduates often feel they have no choice but to choose the positions with the government or state-run enterprises, since those jobs are thought to be stable.\nThat makes those who are happy at work in China a rare find indeed.", "id": "high5599.txt"}
