They're announcing a multi-million dollar international prize to encourage development and research into new forms of low carbon technology. The prize will be available to anyone who can apply a successful method of removing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n     Almost all scientists agree that we are experiencing global warming due to increased amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is released when fuel is burned. Oil, coal and wood are all fuels that release the gas. When biological wasted breaks down, it also releases carbon dioxide.\n     Environmental campaigners and climate change scientists tell us we're pumping an unbearable amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. One way to reduce that will be to use less fossil fuel , the burning of which is a key resource to our way of life, but sharp reduction of oil and coal use is unpopular with governments and people alike.\nSo technologies are being developed, like carbon capture and storage that aim to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, compress  it and pump it into the ground. But that's still in its early stages, so the purpose of this prize is to encourage research into new ways of decarbonizing the atmosphere. A scientific panel, chaired by Al Gore, will judge any entries. Environmental campaigners are hoping such a significant prize will attract large amounts of publicity and brainpower.", "id": "high17872.txt"}
