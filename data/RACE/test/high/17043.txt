Researchers also found that some individuals of normal body weight have an increased risk of the disease.\nBeing overweight does increase your risk of medical problems, but the studies found that not all heavy people are less healthy than thin people.\nIn one study, American researchers examined medical records from over 5000 men and women. Each person had taken part in a separate study from 1999 to 2004. The searchers found that about 51% of them were overweight or obese. About 32% were obese, but considered metabolically healthy. This means they had no evidence of problems in tests for high blood pressure or other factors linked to heart disease. However, more than 23% of people who were at a healthy weight were unhealthy in two or more aspects Judith WylieRosett helped carry out the American study. She says the finding show that all obese person can still be healthy. She believes that having body fat is not as important as where the fat is found on body. It's reported that twothirds of Americans are considered overweight or obese.\nA second study is suggesting that fat in the liver may be an important health risk. Norbert Stefan and his team closely examined 314 people.They measured how much body fat each person had, and where it was on the body. To do this ,they used medical imaging tests. They discovered that obese people could have healthy hearts. Their results suggest that fat in the liver is more dangerous than fat in other areas.\nThe results of both studies were published recently in the Archives of Internal Medicine.Professor WylieRosett says the findings don't mean that people shouldn't be concerned about obesity.  Experts say there are several diseases linked to obesity that make it more dangerous to be fat than thin. They say people should see their doctor to learn what health risks they may be facing and what behaviours should be changed to improve health.", "id": "high17043.txt"}
