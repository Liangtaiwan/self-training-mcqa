There was a high school student robbed three times last year, twice in her school building. There was a girl who got a piece of glass placed in her eye during school and was saved from a possible cornea transplant   only because, having disobeyed the cellphone ban, she was able to call her mother and get an operation on time.\nThe ban has been on for years, but it set off a widespread parental outcry only in April, after some headmasters sent home letters reminding parents that cellphones are not allowed to be brought into school.\nMr Bloomberg has defended the ban, saying that cellphones are bad and often used to cheat or call in friends for fights.
