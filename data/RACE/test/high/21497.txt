For the main trend (, ) in the world's climate in the coming years will, scientists say, be a predictable result of man's activities.\nAt the start of the industrial revolution nearly two centuries ago, man set off a big experiment in planetary engineering. Unaware of what he was doing, he spared no thought for the consequences  .Today the possible outcome is alarmingly clear, but the experiment is unstoppable. Within the lifetimes of many of us, the Earth may become warmer than it has been for a thousand years. By the middle of this century it may be warmer than it has been since before the last Ice Age.\nA warmer climate may seem welcome, but  _ could bring many dangers, damages to crops in the world's main food-producing areas, famine  , economic instability  , civil unrest and even war.\nIn the much longer term, melting of the great ice-caps of Greenland and Antarctica could raise sea-levels throughout the world. The average sea-level has already risen a foot since the turn of the last century, and if the ice-caps disappear completely, it would rise by nearly 200 feet. Complete melting might take many centuries, but even a small increase in sea-level would threaten low-lying parts of the world such as the Netherlands.", "id": "high21497.txt"}
