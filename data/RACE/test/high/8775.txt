Also, is the food good? Are there adequate healthy options? Many admission offices will give prospective students coupons for free meals in the dining halls.\n4.Visit a Class in Your Major\nIf you know what you want to study, a class visit makes a lot of sense.You'll get to observe other students in your field and see how involved they are  in classroom discussion.Try to stay after class for a few minutes and chat with the students to get their impressions of their professors and major.Be sure to call in advance to schedule a classroom visit--most colleges don't allow visitors to drop in on class unannounced.\n5.Talk to Lots of Students\nYour campus tour guide has been trained to market the sch001.Try to talk to students who aren't getting paid to impress you.These important conversations can often provide you with information about co1lege life that isn't part of the admission script.Few university officials wi11 tell you if their students spend all weekend drinking or studying, but a group of random(,) students might.\nFor more tips,please go to collegeapps.about.com.", "id": "high8775.txt"}
