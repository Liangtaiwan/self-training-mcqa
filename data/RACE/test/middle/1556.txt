Are you feeling alone at home? How are you dealing with it?\nZhang Luwen, 12, feels lucky to have a 4-year-old \"brother\". \"With him, I never feel lonely at home. He goes with me wherever I go,\" said the girl of Sichuan Province. But it is not easy to be a sister. Zhang has to help her parents bath her \"brother\" every week. This is because he is hairy -- he is a dog.\nAs the number of pet owners in China grows more and more, Chinese students have animal friends at home. Experts say that these small animals give these only-children lessons in love, care, teamwork and generosity.\nThis month, the first study on the influence of pets on the children came out. It is a survey of 402 Beijing primary school students. It shows that animal friends are good for children.\nChina had more than 90 million only-children by 2006, according to the government. \"In families of three, most children feel lonely. They don't have many chances to learn how to love and be responsible for others,\" said Zhou Xia in the study group. \"So having a pet can help with the problem.\"\nHowever, some students complain that their parents don't allow them to have pets. \"They are afraid a pet would stop me studying,\" said Chen Qi, of Chongqing.\nPerhaps he could learn from Qin Yixing, 13, of Beijing. \"I don't play with my dog until I have finished my homework. I made the promise to my mom and I must keep it,\" said the girl.", "id": "middle1556.txt"}
