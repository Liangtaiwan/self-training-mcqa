One day it was said that the island would go down, so all made boats and left except Love.\nLove was the only one who stayed. Love wanted to offer her help until the last possible moment. When the island had almost gone down, Love decided to ask for help.\nRichness was passing by Love in a great boat. Love said, \"Richness, can you take me with you?\" Richness answered, \"No, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place here for you.\"\nSadness was close by, so Love asked, \"Sadness, let me go with you .\" \"Oh, Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!\"\nHappiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even notice when Love called her.\nSuddenly, there was a voice, \"Come, Love, I will take you.\" It was an elder. Love was so excited that she even forgot to ask who the elder was. So Love asked Knowledge, another elder, \"Who helped me?\" \"It was Time,\" Knowledge answered. \"Time?\" asked Love. \"But why did Time help me?\"\nKnowledge smiled with deep wisdom and answered, \"Because only Time understands how _ Love is.\"", "id": "middle1724.txt"}
