There is plenty to see and do in Sydney apart from the well known attractions of the Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, and Bondi beaches.\nByron Bay\nLocated in New South Wales, just south of the Queensland border, Byron Bay is popular with not just international tourists, but is also a favorite holiday destination of Australians.

There are a range of music festivals over the year that attract international and local musicians alike.\nThe Great Ocean Road\nThe Great Ocean Road, located in Victoria, is one of the best scenic drives of the world. Its official length is 243 kms (roughly 150 miles), but it will take you a full day to enjoy it due to the narrow and windy traffic lanes (only one in each direction).\nDaintree Rainforest\nLocated in northern Queensland, roughly 110 kms north of Cairns, the rainforest is a nature wonderland. It is Australia's largest rainforest, about 20% of Australia's native bird species can be found within the Daintree.\nThe Great Barrier Reef\nLocated in Queensland, this attraction is one of those attractions that are actually known by everyone.
