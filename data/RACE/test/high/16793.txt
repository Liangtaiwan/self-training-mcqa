He was only three when he flooded the kitchen.\n      His mother, Angela Brown is very busy looking after her new baby, a little girl called Laura, as well as Daniel. She told us, \"Daniel is so full of curiosity  .\" At that moment, we hear a loud noise and then silence. We go upstairs and find Daniel getting out of a wardrobe which he has pulled over onto the floor, with a book in his hand. \"It's for you, Mum,\" he says and looks up at his mum and smiles. Seven-year-old Daniel has a lovely face. He has golden hair, big brown eyes, and a friendly smile. I have to admit that Daniel doesn't look like a naughty boy.\n      Angela told me all about it, \"Once I found him as he was about to put Jasper in the washing machine.\" Jasper, she explained, is the Browns' dog. \"When I asked him why, he said that he thought Jasper was dirty! It's amazing how one little boy can cause so much trouble. Another time he cut off all the hair of the little girl next door. She was going to attend her sister's wedding and the neighbors haven't spoken to us since.\"\n      Angela told me about Daniel's most expensive crime. \"I was about to do the washing up when the baby started crying. Daniel decided to help and filled the kitchen sink with water. When I came in, the water was already flooding the kitchen and was about to flood the hall. The carpet was ruined and had to be replaced. I hope things will get better as he gets older.\"\n      Amazingly, Daniel is quite well behaved in school. This may be because he is seldom bored. Meanwhile he continues to be the naughtiest little boy in England. Will his baby sister Laura grow up to be the naughtiest little girl?", "id": "high16793.txt"}
