It is difficult to find a hotel !That is quite funny .Some policemen help us and then we find a hotel! The hotel is on the sixth floor and it is tired to climb up the stairs !The room is very simple but it has a big bathroom.We go out for a walk to visit the city. The Louvre Museum is our favourite one. There are some wonderful pieces of art there. The Eiffel Tower looks so cool from a far place, but when we get close to it, it doesn't look so good. We also don't feel well about the expensive food. Most of the time, we enjoy Paris, but the weather is not always good. It often rains. We feel a little difficult because not many people can speak English and we can't speak French. But I'm still glad that this is the beginning of our travel.", "id": "middle2441.txt"}
