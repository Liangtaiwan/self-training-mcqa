Researchers from Australia say that the presence of the particles  in an eucalyptus tree's leaves indicates that deposits  are buried many meters below. They believe that the discovery offers a new way to locate the valuable metal in difficult-to-reach locations.\n              Dr. Mel Lintern from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) said, \"We've found a lot of the easy deposits in Australia in this way. Now we are trying to find the more difficult ones that are buried tens of meters below. And the trees are providing us with a method to be able to do this.\"\n              Using the Australian synchrotron - a vast machine that uses X-rays to explore matter in remarkable detail - they found gold in the leaves, twigs and bark of some trees. The amount of the precious metal in an eucalyptus tree's leaves were tiny. \"We need 500 eucalyptus trees growing over a gold deposit to have enough gold in the trees themselves to make a gold ring,\" said Dr. Lintern. However, the presence of the particles pointed to richer deposits buried more than 30m below.\n              Dr. Lintern said, \"We believe that the trees are acting like a pump. They are bringing life-giving water from their roots, and in so doing, they are taking smaller dissolved gold particles up into the leaves.\"\n              Currently, the metal is found in outcrops ,where the ore  appears at the surface, or it is detected through exploratory drilling.\n              But the researchers said that analyzing plants could offer a better and simpler method to detect untapped gold deposits. Dr. Lintern said, \"Not only do we believe it is a way of saving the exploration cost, because exploring for these deposits can be quite expensive, it also minimizes the damage to the environment because we are taking a very small sample from the trees themselves, as well as the leaves and twigs on the ground. The plant-analyzing method is certain to work.\"", "id": "high18260.txt"}
