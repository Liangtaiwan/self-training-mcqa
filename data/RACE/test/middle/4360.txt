They were friends.\nOne of them was a large tortoise, one was a medium-sized tortoise and the third was a small tortoise.\nOne day they went into a restaurant and ordered some cakes. While(......) they were waiting for the cakes, they remembered that they didn't bring any money.\n\"Hey, we forgot to bring money to pay for our cakes,\" the big tortoise said.\n\"The little tortoise can go home and get it,\" the medium-sized tortoise said. \"He's the youngest, so he should be the one to go.\"\nThe little tortoise wasn't very happy, but he knew he shouldn't argue with his elders, so he said, \"All right, I'll go. But you must promise  not to eat my cake while I'm away.\"\nThe large tortoise and the medium-sized tortoise agreed, and the little tortoise left for home to get some money.\nA few days later, the big tortoise said to the medium-sized tortoise, \"Let's eat the little tortoise's cake. I'm hungry again.\"\n\"So am I,\" the medium-sized tortoise said, and reached for the cake.\nAs she did so, the little tortoise shouted from near the door of the restaurant, \"If you touch  my cake, I won't go and get the money!\"\n, .", "id": "middle4360.txt"}
