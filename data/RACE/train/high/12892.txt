Their tables will be set with the good dishes and silver, and the dress code will be Sunday best.\nBut in many other homes, this china-and-silver elegance has given way to a stoneware   and stainless informality, with dresses assuming an equally casual-Friday look. For hosts and guests, the change means greater simplicity and comfort. For makers of fine china in Britain, it spells economic hard times. Last week _ , the largest employer in Stoke-on-Trent, announced that it is eliminating 1,000 jobs -- one-fifth of its total workforce. That brings to more than 4, 000 the number of positions lost in 18 months in the pottery   region. Wedgwood and other pottery factories made cuts earlier.\nAlthough a strong pound and weak markets in Asia play a role in the downsizing, the layoffs in Stoke have their roots in earthshaking social shifts. A spokesman for Royal Doulton admitted that the company \"has been somewhat slow in catching up with the trend\" toward casual dining. Families eat together less often, he explained, and more people eat alone, either because they are single or they eat in front of television.

In a time of long work hours and demanding family schedules, busy hosts insist, rightly, that it's better to share a takeout pizza on paper plates in the family room than to wait for the perfect moment or a \"real\" dinner party.\nToo often, the perfect moment never comes. Iron a fine-patterned tablecloth? Forget it. Polish the silver? Who has time? Yet the loss of formality has its down side. The fine points of etiquette   that children might once have learned at the table by observation or instruction from parents and grandparents (\" Chew with your mouth closed.\" \"Keep your elbows off the table. \") must be picked up else-where.
