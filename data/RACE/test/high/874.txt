On my way to school I wondered what sort of questions the other boys would ask me and practiced all the answers: \"I am nine years old. I was born here but I haven't lived here since I was two. I was living in Farley. It's about thirty miles away. I came back to London two months ago.\" I also wondered if it was the custom for boys to fight strangers like me, but I was tall for my age. I hoped they would decide not to risk it.\nNo one took any notice of me before school. I stood in the center of the playground, expecting someone to say \"hello\", but no one spoke to me. When a teacher called my name and told me where my classroom was, one or two boys looked at me but that was all.\nMy teacher was called Mr. Jones. There were 42 boys in the class, so _ , either, until the first lesson of the afternoon. Mr. Jones was very fond of Charles Dickens and he had decided to read aloud to us from David Copperfield, but first he asked several boys if they knew Dickens' birthplace, but no one guessed right. A boy called Brian, the biggest in the class, said: \"Timbuktu\", and Mr. Jones went red in the face. Then he asked me. I said: \"Portsmouth\", and everyone stared at me because Mr. Jones said I was right. This didn't make me very popular, of course.\n\"He thinks he's clever,\" I heard Brian say.\nAfter that, we went out to the playground to play football. I was in Brian's team, and he obviously had Dickens in mind because he told me to go in goal. No one ever wanted to be the goalkeeper.\n\"He's big enough and useless enough.\" Brian said when someone asked him why he had chosen me.\nI suppose Mr. Jones, who served as the judge, remembered Dickens, too, because when the game was nearly over, Brian pushed one of the players on the other team, and he gave them a penalty  . As the boy kicked the ball to my right, I threw myself down instinctively   and saved it. All my team crowded round me. My bare knees were injured and bleeding. Brian took out a handkerchief and offered it to me.\n\"Do you want to join my gang  ?\" he said.\nAt the end of the day, I was no longer a stranger.", "id": "high874.txt"}
