If it had not been the savages who had come to the place to disturb me, I could have been content to spent the rest of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me down and died, like the old goat in the cave.\nI had also arrived to some little recreations and amusements, which made the time pass more pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before.\nAt first, I had taught my Poll to speak. And he did it so familiarly and talked so clearly and plain that it was very pleasant to me. And he lived with me no less than twenty six years. How long he might live afterwards, I don't know; though I know they have an idea in Brazil that they live a hundred years. Perhaps poor Poll may be alive there still, calling Poor Robin Crusoe to this day. I wish no other English man had the bad luck to go there and hear him. But if he did, he would certainly believe it was the devil .\nMy dog was a very pleasant and loving companion to me, for no less than sixteen years of my time, and then died of mere old age.\nAs for my cats, they multiplied to that degree that I had to shoot several of them at first to keep them from eating up all I had.\nBesides these, I had two more parrots which talked pretty well and would all call Robin Crusoe, but none like my first. Nor indeed did I take the pains with any of them that I had done with him.\nI had also several sea-fowls, whose names I don't know, that I caught upon the shore and cut their wings. And the little stakes which I had planted before my castle wall being now grown up to a good thick bush, these fowls all lived among these low trees and bred there, which was very agreeable to me; so that as I said above, I began to be well content with the life I led if not worried about the threat from the savages.", "id": "high6620.txt"}
