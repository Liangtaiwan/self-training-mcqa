A king without a queen. He was the biggest kid in our grade, so he made all the rules during recess. He was a big bully. He told kids what to do, what to play, what to sing, and called them names like "Dork". He always had a smile on his face as he sat on the bench next to the big tree and watched his "kingdom". All of the other kids were scared of him. Even I was scared of him. He was mean and he could beat you up if you made him angry. Last week, a very, very stupid kid chose not to listen to Billy. Billy beat him up and Mr.Stupid Kid told the grownups that he tripped. No one would dare get Billy in trouble. Billy was mean, but he kept the school yard from getting too crazy. Well I had enough it. Billy had been picking on us for too long and we had to stop him. I grabbed some fishing line from home and brought it to school the next day. Before recess, I tied a long piece of fishing line around the tree by Billy's bench and tied the other end to a big rock. Then I went inside for class. When it was recess, Billy sat on his bench and started yelling at people. This was it. I called out, "Hey you big dummy! You're not so tough".

The children from all around the neighborhood loved to climb the tree. The children also liked to sit under the tree, hang on it and play games around it. Animals liked the tree as well. Birds, cats and all kinds of lizards would climb the tree too! Rabbits, dogs, frogs and and many ground animals loved to play around the bottom of the tree.\newline\newlineOne day the children learned the tree was going to be cut down. This made the children, and maybe the animals, very sad. Why was it being cut down? Was it too old? Too weak? Maybe it was dying? The children learned it was because the tree was sick.\newline\newlineThe children were very sad to hear about this. They wondered where they would play from now on. The tree was their favorite place and they didn't want to see it go. One little boy, named John, went home to tell his parents the story. His parents could tell he was sad so they told him something that made him very happy. What was it? He wondered. Was a jungle gym going to be put in? A mall, maybe a park? In fact, even better than that, a new tree would be planted in its place.\newline\newlineJohn was so happy he rushed off to tell his friends. "Big news!", he shouted. "My parents told me a new tree is going to be planted here over the old one!" All his friends cheered in excitement, now knowing they wouldn't lose their favorite spot.

Jack lived near a castle that had a princess trapped in it.  This castle looked and was guarded by an evil dragon named Ryan. The castle was old and dirty.  It wasn't clean or special like many castles are thought to look.  One day Jack thought that he was going to try to save the princess Linda when Ryan was sleeping that night.  After sunset, he slowly walked around and climbed over the back wall.  After passing many sleeping guards, Jack put his nose near the princess's tower window.

Every day when the sun came up Max would run down to the stop and wait until the train stopped and jump on. He thought this was the best time of his life. He always wore a blue collar and a red piece of fabric. Except for on the weekends he would wear a green collar. Sometimes when Max would run next to the train, he would get a splash of mud on his fur. His friend, Bob, didn't like it when Max came home dirty. If Max came home with mud on his fur, Bob would make him sleep outside for the night, but if Max came home clean he would sleep in the house. Max didn't mind sleeping outside, because he could hear the train's whistle and he would dream all night about the train.

They were afraid Sean might get hurt. Sean didn't think so but his bed never stayed green and he was getting tired of doing nothing but making his bed.

I don't really like them. They're too green. I like yellow things."  "If I bring you yellow things, can I have it?" Sean asked. "Yes you can," Zarah said, "But it has to be treasure, or things that won't catch fire."  So Sean went to go find treasure. When he was gone Zarah told the other dragons.

They invited their new friends Jack and Jane to help build the sandcastle. Jack and Jane had a house on the beach, so they were really good when it came to building sandcastles.  They hoped that they could make the sandcastle taller than themselves, but they soon found they needed more help. They asked their cousin Joey to help them build the biggest sandcastle in the world! Joey wasn't the friendliest cousin in the world, but to Billy and Sara's surprise, Joey was happy to help build the sandcastle. Billy, Sara, Jake, Jane and Joey had spent the whole day building the sandcastle, and finally, right before dinner time, they completed it. The sandcastle was huge! It had a river around the castle, and even a bridge to cross the river. It even had a flag at the top, and a wall that went around the castle too!  They were so happy! \tab\newline\newlineThe rest of the week at the beach was a lot of fun for Billy and Sara. On Tuesday, they went for ice cream.

He had spent all of his life under water with his friends, a blow fish named Joey, a sponge named Pam, a star fish named Elaine, and another octopus, Stacey. So you can imagine his surprise when he found a treasure chest that had been lost by a ship that had sunk. Inside the chest were things that were completely new to him. Among these was a whole bunch of food items, such as a bottle of ketchup, a coffee mug, a cherry pie, a sandwich, and more. When Fred found these things, he wanted to keep them all for himself. So when he returned to his friends, he didn't tell them what he had found. When his best friend Stacey asked him where he had been, Fred lied and said that he had only gone for a swim. But Stacey didn't believe him. Later on, when Fred was sound asleep in his bed, Stacey visited his room to see what he had been up to. She went digging around in his room for something interesting. When she found the treasure chest, she was amazed at what was inside. But she was also upset at Fred for lying to her, so she woke up him in the middle of the night to yell at him.

In his free time, he would make drawings about how much he wished he could fly. He would look up at the stars in wonder, hoping that some day, his dream might come true. For many years, his life carried on this way. He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying. That is, until one day, he got a letter with a strange sticker on it, that was shaped like a star. He opened the letter in excitement, wondering what it said. The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds. Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly. If he chose to go to the party, he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals. Oink was so happy, he barely knew how to react. He accepted the invitation, and two days later, got a package containing his wings. Oink's dream was finally coming true. He put the wings on his back and flew up into the sky, where the party was being held. Once he arrived, he saw a bunch of other animals with wings also. He saw horses, dogs, cats, and plenty of birds. Oink had found out that it was the birds who had invited everyone, since they wanted the other animals to know what it is like to fly. Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends. But when the clock reached midnight, he knew his time flying was up, and he had to return the wings and go back to his farm. But the birds told him that they saw how much he enjoyed flying, and would allow him to keep his wings so he could fly with them whenever he wanted. Oink was really thankful, and next time he saw the birds, gave them their own pair of shoes for free as a thank you gift.	multiple: What was Oink's dream?

He met Jessica one afternoon at a park on a hot summer day.  They both started talking and became great friends.  They spent the whole day together and ate their lunches together next to the pond.  Kevin sure enjoyed the park more than he liked going to the beach or store.  There were many ducks, frogs, birds and chipmunks playing around the pond.  In fact, one of the chipmunks even came up and stole Kevin's car keys when he was eating!  Kevin knew that he needed to go have his keys, but the chipmunk ran with an evil smile on its face.  Eventually, the chipmunk ran into its hole that he called home.  Kevin tried everything he could to have the chipmunk come out with his keys, but he couldn't find out how to make the little guy give up.  Finally, Jessica came over and placed a potato chip at the opening to the hole.  In seconds, the chipmunk came out with the keys and dropped them in front of Kevin right before grabbing the chip and running back into the hole.  The chipmunk then went in to have his snack and left Kevin and Jessica alone.  Kevin thought that maybe next time he could go to the park in the early spring or winter so that the chipmunks would be busy sleeping during the cold weather months.

His father's name was George, and he was 2 years older than Marge. Marge looked sad and told Jerry that George had left after he was born because the people in the town didn't like him. This made Jerry very sad. He went off to his corner of the car and didn't talk to Marge again until she went to bed. After she fell asleep he wanted to go out and look for his father.

They found out his name was Henry. Henry was on his way to the river for a drink of water when a mean horse ran by and without looking at where he was going stepped on his leg and broke it. Luckily for Henry Busters mom was a nurse and after watching her work for many years Buster knew how to set a broken bone and fix it. After Buster fixed Henry's leg he picked him up and put him on Timmy's back and they all went to the river to get some water. They all were best friends for the rest of their lives and played together.	one: What animal was Timmy?	Bear	Hamster	Tiger	Horse	one: Who broke Henry's leg?

He's eleven years old like me, and to be honest, everyone likes to always mix us up. It's not that we look alike or sound alike or even dress alike, but it's our names, Tim and Tom, that do it. Anyways, he likes dinosaurs, board games, and toy cars so I'm not sure if anything under ten dollars has both of those in it. He also told me not to get anything that has feathers included in it as his mom always gets headaches when she's around them.\newline\newlineMy mom took me to the store and I looked around for something Tom would like. We had to pass through the clothing, medicine, and jewelry sections before we got to the toy aisle. My mom told me to not let her forget that we need to go to the garden section to get a new sprinkler before we go, but I was too into the toys to understand her. Finally, I found a board game where you play as different cars to try and finish a race first and thought that was perfect even without the dinosaurs. From there, we checked out and I gave the present to Tom on his birthday. He loved it and we played with our other friends, Daryl, John, and Angie. Sadly our other friend, James couldn't make it as he was sick, but we still had so much fun together.	multiple: How are Tim and Tom mixed up by others?

One day she went for a walk to see if any of the spring flowers had started to bloom.  Her mother's birthday was the next day.  If there were flowers blooming she would pick some for her mother. Her mother's name was Queen Alice.  As she got deeper into the woods she came to a place that had a lot of flowers.  There were beautiful lilies growing around the edge of a pond.  There were some deer drinking water from the pond.  She picked some lilies for her mother, the queen.  The lilies were white and yellow and red.  She picked 12 lilies for her mother.  Lizzie also saw mushrooms growing in the woods.  There were birds building a nest in the bushes.  Under the bush she saw a paper cup that someone had left. There were beautiful butterflies on the bush, too. The sun was warm so she lay down to rest under the shade of a tree.  She fell asleep and as she was sleeping she had a bad dream.  She dreamed that as she was walking through the woods. In her dream she tripped over a log and hurt her ankle.  She started to cry because she was afraid that nobody would miss her and she would have to sleep in the woods.

All spiders have to get rid of their old skin in order to grow a new, larger skin. Twinkle Toes was a very special kind of spider because his tenth new skin would be pink instead of blue. When it was time for Twinkle Toes to turn pink, he was very excited, but he was also worried. He was afraid that his best friend, an orange cat named Morty Roo, wouldn't know that the pink spider was Twinkle Toes in his new skin. He was scared that Morty Roo would mistake him for a normal spider who does not change colors. If Morty Roo saw a spider who wasn't Twinkle Toes, he would likely kill the spider and eat it. Twinkle Toes was hoping to tell Morty Roo that he would soon turn pink, but Morty Roo didn't come around to visit that day. Twinkle Toes called over Woofington, the neighbor's dog.  Twinkle Toes asked Woofington to please tell Morty Roo that he would be pink after he grew his new skin but would still be the same Twinkle Toes he had always been.  Woofington normally liked to chase Morty Roo around the neighborhood. He knew he would have to be nice to Morty Roo to deliver the message and that it would be really hard. Because it was so important to Twinkle Toes, Woofington said he would deliver the message. Woofington had a special respect for spiders because they eat other bugs.

The tree grew next to a river in a large, green forest. Twinkles loved to fly around the forest with her best friend Betsy the Bat. Betsy was a very forgetful bat. One day Twinkles and Betsy were playing next to the bushes by the river bank when Betsy shouted, "Oh no, I've forgotten my lunch that my mom packed for me today! It is late in the afternoon and I am hungry."\newline\newline"Do not worry," said Twinkles. "I am going to wait here for you until you get back."\newline\newlineWith that, Betsy flew off toward her home in the wet cave near the other end of the river. An hour went by and Betsy still had not returned. "Hmm," thought Twinkles, "I wonder where Betsy went off to." Twinkles flew off to find her best friend.\newline\newlineSoon, she heard a voice calling from down below. "Help me! I'm stuck!" Twinkles looked down. Sure enough, it was Betsy! She had been caught in a pile of sticky mud near the mouth of the cave. \newline\newline"Don't worry, I am coming to save you!" cried Twinkles. Twinkles swooped down to the ground. She found a strong stick nearby that she could use to help her pull Betsy out of the thick mud. Betsy grabbed the end of the stick that Twinkles held out to her. After some heavy tugging, Betsy was free.\newline\newline"Thank you so very much for pulling me out of the mud! I was looking for some berries to use for jam down by the river. They grow on the bushes there. I wanted some for a little dessert after my lunch. I accidentally walked into the pile of mud on the floor and got stuck."\newline\newline"No problem," said Twinkles.

They did not really care for baseball, basketball or soccer much. They enjoy it so much that they like to draw silly pictures on to their arms and notebooks showing footballs. Then when the teacher sees them they have to use the pink erasers to erase the drawings. One day Mark was out playing football when he tripped and hurt his knee, the next day Matthew was also playing football when he fell and hurt his arm. Both boys could not play their favorite games now. So to cheer them up, Matthew's parents bought them a new football game they could play at home. When Mark showed up to play, they had also made chocolate chip pancakes as a present to both of them, even if both of their favorite food was bacon, waffles and hamburgers. After some time both boys got bored with the game and thought to build their own. So they got some cardboard and tape and built a small table top football game. After that they were busy enough to forget their own hurt parts and had a lot of fun that day.	multiple: Which of the boys hurt his knee, and from what?

Billy soon got tired of Juno's game, so he left her in the garden hoping she would keep running around and tire herself out.   Sasha the kitten followed Billy and Juno was surprised to find herself alone, she had hoped Billy would keep on playing this fun game.

On cold winter days, he would wiggle out from the hay stack to get closer to the lamp in the barn, getting some extra warmth. One winter day, the mouse was very cold, but needed something to eat. He left the hay stack, and ran past the lamp. He ran across an old wood board that was laying on top of the snow - the mouse didn't have mittens and wanted to keep his feet warm. He ran and ran until he couldn't any longer. The cold weather was keeping every living thing inside, so the mouse was all alone. He walked towards the house and met a little bug named Fred. Fred told the mouse that he went inside and found lots of crumbs to eat on the kitchen floor. The mouse waited until the farmer's wife, Julie, came out the back door, and then the mouse ran into the kitchen. There were bread crumbs everywhere! The mouse ate as many as he could before anyone found him. He heard the back door open again, and hid under the oven. It was warm there - there must have been a pie baking.

"You run along outside to go play with your friends," her mom told her, "I can get everything ready for your special lunch on my own."  \newlineWhen Ashley made it outside, she found her friend Katherine playing in the dirt.  When Ashley came closer, she saw that in the dirt were a bunch of insects.  Katherine loved finding and collecting different ones for her insect collection.  Ashley thought it was kind of gross personally, but she sat down next her anyways.\newline"Happy birthday, Ashley," Katherine yelled when she saw her best friend.\newline"Thank you," Ashley answered, "Do you want to go up to the playground until it's time for lunchtime?  Mom says you're invited to come by the way."\newlineKatherine nodded, and the two spent a fun morning playing on the playground.  Once lunchtime came, the two walked back to Ashley's house.  She could picture how many of her favorite foods her mom had most likely made, and she could almost taste the spaghetti on her tongue.  Lunch was ready when they arrived, and it was delicious!

The park is very big and has lots of ladders and slides. My favorite thing to do at the park is to swim in the lake. The lake is small but there are a lot of red fish that live in it. There are also some turtles and worms at the bottom of the lake. Sometimes the fish swim by my leg and make me laugh and feel happy. One time I stepped on a stick and cut my foot. That cut hurt and made me sad. The next time I went in the lake I was scared that I would get another cut. Another thing I like to do at the park is to feed the animals. There are lots of pigs, squirrels and raccoon living in the park. Sometimes I feed them bread and crackers. Their favorite thing to eat is ham. After I am done at the park I go to the store to buy some ice cream. Sometimes I see my friend Christopher and he eats his ice cream with me. Christopher also likes feeding the animals.

Working at the pet shop has been my dream ever since I was a little girl, so actually getting to work with and help take care of the kitties, puppies, lizards and all sorts of animals is the coolest thing to happen to me. Some people dream of being a doctor, or a nurse, or even a teacher, but I've always wanted to work with pets. I'll say, like many people, I do have fears and that fear is snakes so I won't get to take care of them!\newline\newline\tabI arrived at the pet store around nine in the morning and was greeted by the friendly woman that owned it who I talked with over the phone. Her hair was covering her name tag so I couldn't tell if her name was Martha, Margaret, or Mary, but it turns out she told me it was Margie so none of them were right. Margie helped me become friendly with all the animals, and I had so much fun the whole day. I fed them, gave them water, and even got to play with them! Margie didn't think I was ready to clean up after them yet so she said that could be done another day.

The man and woman did not love one another or anything else. The man was a wood man and often spent days alone in the wood. One day the man spent more time in the wood and he became lost. After days and days he grew hungry and weak. When he thought for sure he was going to die a tall wizard appeared before him. The man did not know the wizard had placed a spell on him, making him get lost, but he did.\newline\newlineThe wizard smiled at the man in a friendly way and said to him, "I can show you the way out of the woods, if you give me the one thing you love most in the world."\newline\newlineSince there was nothing that the man loved, he said yes at once. The Wizard showed the man the way home and then disappeared into the wood. The man and woman lived well for many years and the man never told his meeting to the wizard and after a time, he too forgot about his promise. \newline\newlineIn time the woman gave birth and the man had a daughter who he loved. One day the wizard came to the door to take the girl, making the man remember his promise. The man was very sad to lose his daughter. But in the end he had to give her over to the wizard. The wizard was bad and locked the girl away in a cave. Every day the girl grew to be prettier and smarter. Every day the Wizard asked if the girl would marry him, but he was mean and she would not marry him. And every time the girl said no, the wizard would find a new way to make her sad. But the girl had found a secret flower that was very beautiful.\newline\newline"If you marry me I can let you out."\newline\newline"There is a lovely bit of sunlight that comes in through the rocks. I am very happy here in my cave." The girl said. The wizard became angry and steam poured from his eyes\newline\newlineHe blocked out the sun so the girl lived only in darkness. Still the girl said no. The wizard came back again and told the girl, "If you marry me I can let you out." The wizard became angry and steam poured from his mouth\newline\newline"There is a lovely stream of water that comes in through the rocks. I am very happy here in my cave." The girl said. The wizard became angry and steam poured from his ears\newline\newlineHe blocked out the water so the girl lived only in dry sand. Still the girl said no. The wizard came back again and told the girl, "If you marry me I can let you out."\newline\newlineAgain, the girl only said "There is a soft wind that comes in through the rocks. I am very happy here in my cave." The wizard became angry and steam poured from his ears and fire came out of his eyes\newline\newlineSo the Wizard blocked out the wind and left the girl in a hot cave with no air. But the girl would still not marry him. The wizard became so angry he turned to flame and burned up. The girl was free and went down to her flower only to find it was gone. Instead she found a handsome prince. \newline\newline"I thank you my lady," he said, "for saving me from the evil wizard. In return you may come live in my palace with me and be happy."\newline\newlineThe girl said yes.

One day he was playing at chasing Indians in his room when he heard a loud crack of thunder. He got really scared. Bill's parents, Ned and Susan, came into his room. They told him not to be scared. They said they were going to make sure the car windows were shut and they would be back soon. Bill said okay. He climbed under his bed and listened to the wind outside. He had his favorite toy gun to keep him safe, but he was still scared because his parents weren't back yet. His brother Zack had given him the gun. Bill started to think he could hear voices in the wind. It sounded like a strange kind of chanting. He started to shake and hug his toy gun. He said, "I'm not afraid of you. If you try to hurt me I'll shoot you." After that he felt a little better. But then he jumped as his bedroom door slammed shut. He hit his head on the bottom of his bed and it hurt. He looked out from under his blanket and saw a strange orange light in his room. He was worried that it was on fire, but he couldn't smell any smoke.	multiple: What did Bill think had happened to his room after the door slammed shut?	The Indians had attacked it.

At camp they had lots of fun activities like swimming, wood carving, and telling ghost stories. At camp there weren't any restaurants or grocery stores, so for food they would have to make their own meals. One thing they could do is make peanut butter sandwiches, which every scout was given at the start of camp. But pretty soon everyone was sick of peanut butter sandwiches and wanted to eat something else instead. Some boys went out into the forest and picked out berries and roots that were safe to eat. Some boys even took out the boat and went fishing. They came back with a big fish that they cleaned and cooked themselves.\newline\newlineAt first, Frank's mom was very worried about letting Frank go to camp. She was worried that he could get lost in the woods and be eaten by a bear. She was worried that he might get into a fight with the other boys. She was even worried that he wouldn't shower or take a bath for the whole two weeks. But Frank's scout masters explained to Frank's mom that the camp leaders were very serious about taking care of the campers and that everything would be perfectly safe for Frank. Frank promised to call home at least every two days. So in the end Frank's mom let Frank go to camp.	one: Which of the following was a camp activity.	Telling ghost stories.	Taking a shower.
