You don't need to care about those who have beautiful houses with large  gardens and swimming pools or those who have nice cars and lots of money and so on. Why? .Because  those who have big house may often feel lonely and those who have cars may want to walk on the country roads at their free time.\nIn fact, happiness is always around you if you put your heart into it. When you are in trouble at school, your friends will help you; when you study hard at your lessons, your parents are always taking good care of your life and your health; when you get success, your friends will say congratulations to you; when you  do something good to others, you will feel happy, too.All these are your happiness. If you notice them, you can see that happiness is always around you.\nHappiness is not the same as money.It is a feeling of your heart. When you are poor, you can also say you are very happy, because you have something else that can't be bought with money. When you meet with difficulties, you can say loudly you are very happy, because you have bad luck. As the saying goes, life is like a _ door. When it closes, it also opens.  If you take every chance you get,  you  can be a happy and lucky person.", "id": "middle5005.txt"}
