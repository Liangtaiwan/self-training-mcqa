He was one of the most intelligent people I've ever known.\nEvery Sunday the Philippine Star Newspaper had a special page for word puzzles and among his peers  , Mr.Filio held the record for solving all the puzzles in less than five minutes. He encouraged me to solve them too, and for months and months, I did my best to beat him but failed.\nThen one Sunday, I did it! I was able to complete them before anyone else. Everyone cheered for me. He came up to me with a smile and said,  \" No one has ever beaten me before. You are the first. I'll have a prize for you tomorrow.\"\nThe next day, he gave me a special Scrabble set. I would have never been able to afford one like that by myself. Then he said to me,  \" Kate, what do you think is man's final goal in life? Happiness, isn't it? You are happy and that should be considered as a success.

And true to his words, I was never able to beat him again.", "id": "high11015.txt"}
