We need stop cutting down all of the trees so that they can absorb the carbon dioxide. I think the Kyoto Protocol  to stop pollution is a great idea ,and I hope our country will decide to follow it, too.[: http://wx.jtyjy.com/]\n-- Eli S.,10,Texa\nPeople should do all they can to help stop pollution, even if it is something as little as recycling your soda can. Every little thing helps. Maybe schools can put recycling bins in classrooms. Students can bring in all of their cans and bottles and see how many the school can collect.\n-- Lindsey A.,11, Massachusett[: http://wx.jtyjy.com/.Com]\nThe United States should take action to help stop pollution. Since we are one of the richest countries, we should at least spend a little money to help.\n-- Aaron z,11,Massachusett\nIt is not good that the United States is not following the Kyoto Protocol. The U.S. is one of the most pollutionemitting countries in the world. Even if the rest of the world agrees to follow those rules, without the U. S. and its big businesses agreeing, global warming will still be a big problem.\n--Augustine S.,11,Ohio\nThe world needs to learn more about global warming problems. If we do not do something soon then some of Earth's coolest animals will become extinct. People should use solar power instead of things that pollute the atmosphere!\n-- Jillian J.,10,Pennsylvania\nGlobal warming is very dangerous, and it must be prevented. Even if people think that it cannot be stopped ,we should  at least try. Stopping global warming is more important than keeping our businesses going. What about thepenguins and the polar bears? We can't just let them become extinct.\n--Samantha R.,11,Illinois", "id": "high7765.txt"}
