Sometimes the weather gets bad. Accidents can happen easily and quickly.\nOne family once had an accident. A big fish swam under their boat and bit holes in it. Sea water came in and the boat soon went down. Luckily these people had another small boat----a lifeboat, so they all got into the lifeboat. They lived in the boat for many days. They ate and slept, and always hoped. At last people in a ship saved them.\nHow do people live in a very small lifeboat for a long time? They must be strong in every way, they must have a hope, and they must have a strong desire to live. People cannot drink seawater. If they drink a lot of sea water, they will quickly die. They must catch rainwater and drink it. They must also catch fish and birds for food. Lifeboats do not often carry cookers. So people can not cook their food in the lifeboats. Raw   fish and birds are not very nice but they are their only food. They must eat raw food, or they will die.", "id": "middle1678.txt"}
