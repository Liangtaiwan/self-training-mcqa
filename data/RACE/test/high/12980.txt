Alicia is waiting for you outside,\" my mother called from the kitchen. My mother didn't like me going for this weekend to my friend's house in the mountains. \"I trust you, but I don't trust the people out there,\" she said seriously. \"I'm going to be fine,\" were my last words before closing the door of the Jeep. The vehicle went along the dusty road and my mother grew smaller in the distance.\nThe trip over the rough road was uncomfortable. It was scary to climb the steep hills surrounded by great pines. After a long trip we finally arrived at the house. From the moment I got there I knew I would forever love the house. It was decorated like an old country home. My room was small, yet set up nicely. That night I went to sleep early, not because I didn't want to continue my search, but because I was tired after the long trip.\nIn the morning, the singing of the birds woke me up. The light was just getting through the window. A strong smell of baking and fresh coffee came from the kitchen. I wandered around looking for a living soul, but the house was empty. I had the whole day to myself; my friend had gone hiking. I didn't want to go with her. The main reason for this trip was to spend some time alone to think about the events happening in my life.\nAfter an icy shower, my energies were at their fullest. With basket in hand, I started my hunt. I did not mind walking alone; it was a wonderful feeling to be in contact with nature for the first time. The sound of the water running through the rocks gave me great peace. I never felt such independence in my soul before.", "id": "high12980.txt"}
