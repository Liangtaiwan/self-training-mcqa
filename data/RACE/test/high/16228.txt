It means that as a human being you take responsibility for your own life.\nLook at the word responsibility: ability to choose your response, response-ability. Effective people are proactive because they take responsibility. Their behavior is a product of their own decisions, based on values, rather than being a product of their own conditions, based on feelings.For instance, you are planning a picnic with your family.You're excited.You have all the preparations.You've decided where to go, and then it becomes stormy, killing your plan.Proactive people\n. They realize what their purpose really was, and they creatively have a picnic elsewhere even if it's in their own basement with some special games, and make the best of that situation.The opposite of being proactive is to be reactive.Reactive people would say, \"What's the use?\" \"We can't do anything.\" \"Oh this is so upsetting after all of our preparations and arrangements.\" They try to persuade the people around them and usually the picnic will be cancelled.\nBeing proactive is really just being true to your human nature. Your basic nature is to act, and not to be acted upon.That's true, despite widely accepted theories of determinism used to explain human nature. Determinism says that you don't really choose anything and that what you call choices are nothing more than automatic responses to outside conditions.\nThe language of reactive people is like: \" I can't.\" \" Don't have time.\" \" I have to.\" \" I must.\" The whole spirit of that language is the transfer of responsibility.They think things are determined by their environment, or by their conditions, or by their conditioning or their genetic makeup.Psychologically, people who believe they are determined will produce the evidence to support the belief, and they increasingly feel victimized and out of control.They're not in charge of their life at all.\nOn the contrary, a proactive person exercises free will, the freedom to choose the response that best applies to his values.In that way, he gains control over the circumstances, rather than being controlled by them.", "id": "high16228.txt"}
