So was her boyfriend.\n\"Later I realized that she didn't literally mean what she said and that she was not aware of the full meaning of the word 'hate' in English,\" said Du. \"It was more a problem with translation,\" she added.\nCultural differences can cause confusion about what words or even actions mean, an issue that has come to the forefront recently following the arrest of a Chinese doctoral degree student in New Jersey.\nZhai Tiantian, who studied at the Stevens Institute of Technology, has been accused of trying to set fire to a campus building and of making threats to a professor who gave him a low mark. No physical _ took place but Zhai reportedly said something along the lines of \"at worst, I will risk anything on the line.\" The professor called the campus police.\nAccording to the indictment sheet , Zhai is facing the serious charge of making a terroristic threat.\nFor a few days, Chinese media mistranslated, or misunderstood, the charges and reported that Zhai was being charged with terrorism.\nSome language experts have speculated  that the disagreement between Zhai and the professor can also be chalked up to cultural and linguistic differences. \"What Chinese people regard as acceptable speech may be regarded by Americans as threats,\" said Luo Gang, the Chinese Consulate's Overseas Chinese Affairs consul. \"This is an unfortunate incident. Even though Zhai intended no harm, he has done himself a great deal of harm.\"\nDu, now 23, said she supports Zhai's actions in fighting to save his academic career, but added he needs to learn more about communication in a foreign language.\n\"Chinese students in a foreign country must prepare more in terms of languages and conversation skills to avoid misunderstandings,\" she said.", "id": "high726.txt"}
