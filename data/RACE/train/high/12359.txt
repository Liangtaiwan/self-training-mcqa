He was making his first trip to Texas and happened to be seated next to a Texan on the flight.\nThe Texan spent a lot of time telling him how everything was bigger and better in Texas. After the blind man reached his destination, a large resort   hotel, he was very excited about being in Texas.\nThe long trip had worn him out a little so he decided to stop at the bar for a small soda and a light snack before going up to his room to sleep.\nWhen the waitress set down his drink, it was in a huge cup. \"Wow, I had heard everything in Texas is bigger,\" he told her.\n\"That's right,\" she replied. The blind man ate his snack and finished his drink. After drinking such a large amount, it was natural that his next stop was to be the restroom. He asked the waitress for directions. She told him to turn left at the corner, and then take the second door on the right.\nHe reached the first door and continued. A few steps later he stumbled   slightly and missed the second door and ended up going through the third door instead. Not realizing he had entered the swimming area he walked forward and immediately fell into the swimming pool.\nRemembering that everything was bigger in Texas, he had his head above water and started shouting \"Don't flush ! Don't flush!\"", "id": "high12359.txt"}
