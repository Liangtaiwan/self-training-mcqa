However, as time goes by, you're faced with so many problems in life. Below are five techniques that can help you get relaxed.\n1. Mind your own business.\nYes, please mind your own business. When you start being concerned about things which are not related to you, you lose your control on your thought process, which often has negative results disturbing the mental peace. Basically, your mind starts wandering here and there. So next time an unnecessary thought comes to your mind, think whether this is really something you should be worrying for? If not, keep it away and focus on something positive, practical and fruitful.\n2. Surround yourself with positive people.\n _ negative comments and stay away from negative souls. When someone is negative, he spreads negativity and you get affected. Staying with such people will have long term influence on your character so think about your company.\n3. Don't think about others too much.\nRemember: _ Don't allow your brain to compare yourself to others as this is an insult   to yourself. Don't be jealous; it's a heart killing disease, get rid of it as soon as possible. When you are jealous you focus on finding faults in others even if they don't have. This poisons your soul and steals the mental peace.\n4. You can't keep everyone happy.\nDon't be oversensitive  . Be natural in what you do. Be positive and constructive in your deeds and then don't really care too much about others. Be aware, don't apply this to too closed relations. Develop trust to build up powerful relationships.\n5. Don't believe yourself to be unlucky.\nRemember this: Bad luck happens to everyone. It's not your fault at all. Time, whether good or bad, passes quickly. Develop the power of not looking back into your past. Believe in the power of Now. Believe in your skills. Work hard and you will get what you have been entitled for. Be patient and see what has been planned for you.\nWith these recommendations, I believe if you can make it, it's probable that you can bring changes in your lifestyle and get back your mental peace.", "id": "high10308.txt"}
