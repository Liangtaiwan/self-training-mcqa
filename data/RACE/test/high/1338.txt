Can you still remember how you dressed at the start of China's opening-up? Today's program is one of a special series commemorating   the 30th anniversary of reform and opening-up in China. In these two episodes we focused on fashion and style and were honored to invite two special guests to join us in studio--Ms. Zhang Ling from Raffles-BICT Inter-national College and Alex from Esquire magazine.\nWhen we talk about fashion, color is absolutely crucial. A color can reflect the mood of an individual person or the spiritual temperament  of entire society or age. Mrs. Zhang and Alex talked about the colors which have left the greatest impression on them. In the 1960s and 70s, blue and grey were the dominant colors at the time and people had limited choices to dress up. But fast forward to the present, you will find no difficulty in choosing from array  of vivid colors in the market.\nWe also gave our guests a list of keywords--traditional brands, jeans, DIY, international brands, personal dress for them to choose from in order to represent the fashion of their generation. We find out that for every keyword our guest chose, there was a special story behind it. Some of the stories brought us back to old times--we even brought some vintage  clothing from the 60s and 70s up on stage and invited some audience members to try them on.\nWhen we mention fashion, we must mention brand. With increasing disposable  income and purchasing power of the Chinese, many luxury brands have flocked into China. However, you could imagine in 1980s, when the first inter-national brand came to China, it unveiled  a fashion storm among the Chinese.", "id": "high1338.txt"}
