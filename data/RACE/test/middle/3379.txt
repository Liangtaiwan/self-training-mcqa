Exploring the Internet is one of the most important activities of the day. The Internet brings the outside world closer to people's homes. Some people say the world is smaller than before because of the Internet.\nWhat's going on in other countries? How do people live in places far away? Is there a good sports game somewhere? What's the life like in the deepest part of sea? If you want to answer all these questions, just come to the Internet. Of course, people can also learn through reading or listening to the radio. But with the Internet they can learn better and more easily. A lot of information can be collected at a great speed.\nCan we go shopping without leaving home? Can we see a doctor without going to the hospital? Can we study without going to school? Can we draw money without going to bank? All these things seemed to be impossible, but now they have become quite possible.\nThe Internet helps us open our eyes. The Internet also helps open our minds. The Internet often gives us new ideas. In a word, it helps us in many ways. Great changes have taken place in our life since the appearance of the Internet.\n,.", "id": "middle3379.txt"}
