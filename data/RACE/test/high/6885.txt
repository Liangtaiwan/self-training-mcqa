Everyone is astonished to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive.\nTom is the hero of the story,but there are other important characters.Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him.Becky is pretty with fair hair,Joe is Tom's best friend.and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story.\nThe theme of the  story  is about children growing up.It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America. Finally, it talks about freedom,social rules and how people are  punished for bad behaviour.\nWhy do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876,but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story, Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in  the 19th century,so it sounds very real. Today it's thought to be one of the greatest books in American literature. Go on--- read it! I know you'll enjoy it,too.", "id": "high6885.txt"}
