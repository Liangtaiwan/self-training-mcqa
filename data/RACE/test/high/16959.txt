Here is a list of practical steps you can take to prepare and protect yourself and your family.\n1) Know the symptoms-- Here are some of the symptoms that sound like swine flu -- fevers over 100 degrees (37.8degC), body aches, cough, runny nose, and sometimes, nausea   and diarrhea  . It's also useful to know if you might have had an exposure   either by recent travel to Mexico, or to the areas of known cases so far in America -- specific areas of California, Texas, New York, Ohio and Kansas. Or you may have been exposed to a sick person who came from those areas. \n2) Don't panic-- If you have symptoms that sound like swine flu, do not rush to hospitals. Not only is this difficult for the healthcare system, it can also be potentially dangerous for everyone. Call your doctor or local public health clinic before going in.\n3) Contain the illness-- Hand-washing works. Wash, wash and wash. Invest in some hand sanitizer   for the whole family. Avoid hugs and kisses of well-wishers, and do not share telephone handsets or computers. Be especially careful to always cough into the elbow of your arm (yes! the elbow, not your hand!). Cover your cough and sneeze to protect others. \n4) What about a mask?-- The data shows that masks do work --as long asthere is a tight seal   about the mouth and nose. \n5) Eat the pork(if you want) -- Swine flu gets its name because pigs can get the infection and spread it to each other -- as well as to humans. This latest virus contains pieces that indicate it evolved   from swine flu virus, and can now spread from person to person. Swine flu is not spread by properly prepared and cooked pork products. So if you want to eat pork, you can.\n6) Getting sick? Stay home!-- In our go-go-go culture and these severe economic times, it can be very hard to call a boss and cancel a day's work. Now, however, if you or your loved ones are feeling like there's a flu coming on, stay home.\n7) Stockpile?-- Right now, it's too early for any of us to become a Swine Flu Shut-In, but the public health department recommends that each home have two weeks of supplies, in case we must stay home -- either for illness or to help contain transmission. That means two weeks of food for everyone in your home, two weeks of all medications, and, if you're like most people, two weeks of books and DVDs.", "id": "high16959.txt"}
