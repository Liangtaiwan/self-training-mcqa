He's very lucky with his timing. He grew up having other kittens to play and socialize with, and was used to people from the moment he was born since there are always kids hanging around the barn. He was a favorite amongst the students at the barn. However, when it came time to find the kittens homes, no one knew where Jack would end up. That's when I got an e-mail from my friend. All she asked was \"Do you still want one of the kittens? There's one here with no eyes and no one can take him.\" Without thinking I told her that I did want the kitten.\nWhen we first brought him home Jack walked cautiously around, sniffing everything. He went through a time when he could climb the stairs, but couldn't get down. He would sit at the top and cry until someone came and got him. Every now and then when he gets disoriented he'll stop and cry. But we just call his name and talk to him and it isn't long before he finds his way back to us.\nAlso, a few weeks after getting Jack, we got a new barn cat named Bear. I always take Jack outside at that time for some fresh air and exercise. He loves to run (at top speed!) around the backyard and gardens. Bear and Jack have become best friends. Jack always knows when Bear is around. He'll run across the yard straight to Bear and wrap his front legs around his neck in a big hug. When they're tired they'll lie down in the grass together.\nJack is truly an inspiration. I've owned a lot of kittens in my life, but Jack is the happiest, most playful of them all. People who know Jack don't feel sorry for him. They cherish him for the treasure that he is. I have talked to a few people who haven't met him personally and tend to pity him, but they just don't understand. Jack doesn't need pity. I think that cats like him don't have disabilities; they have adaptabilities.", "id": "high19761.txt"}
