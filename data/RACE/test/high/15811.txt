They choose a quiet place, dig a deep hole and bury the treasure in it. Then they make a map of where the treasure is or write down other clues that will help them or someone else to find it again.\nIn Britain a few years ago, a writer wrote about some treasure that he had buried. He put clues in the story to help readers find it. Thousands of people hunted for the treasure. They dug holes all over Britain, hoping to find it.\nOne of the most popular adventure stories ever written is Robert Louis Stephenson's \"Treasured Island\", an exciting story about a young boy, Jim Hawkins, who is captured by pirates   and later finds some buried treasure.\nThen there is the true story about a man who had to travel overseas for a year. He did not trust banks, so he buried his life savings in a park. Then he went away. On his return, he went straight to the park. But the park was no longer there. In its place there was a huge building.\nAnd then there was the man who buried his savings, all in bank notes, in a waterproof bag. When he dug it up years later, there was nothing left. Worms and insects had eaten the bag and everything in it.\nAnd of course, these are stories about people who bury things and either forget where they have buried them or lose the map.\nAlthough it is true that people sometimes lose their money because a bank fails, banks are still the safest place to keep our savings and treasures.", "id": "high15811.txt"}
