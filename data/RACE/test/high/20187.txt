And a story can be told about each of them. \"Hot\" is a simple, easily-understood word. So are most of the expressions made with the word \"hot\".  But not always, as we shall see. \nTake the phrase \"hot potato\" for example. The potato is a popular vegetable in the United States. Many people like baked potatoes, cooked in an oven or fire. Imagine trying to carry a hot, baked potato in your hand. It would be difficult, even painful, to do so. One such hot potato is taxes. Calling for higher taxes can mean defeat for a politician. And yet, if taxes are not raised, some very popular government programs could be cut, which can also make a politician very unpopular. \nAnother expression is \"not so hot\". If you ask someone how she feels, she may answer: \"Not so hot. \" What she means is that she does not feel well. \"Not so hot\" is also a way of saying that you do not really like something. \n\"A hot shot\" is a person, often a young person, who thinks he can do anything. At least he wants to try. He is very sure he can succeed. But often he fails. The expression came from the army. A hot shot was a soldier who fired without aiming carefully.\nA person who becomes angry easily is called \"a hothead\". An angry person's neck often becomes red. We say he is \"hot under the collar\". You could say that your friend is no hothead. But he got hot under the collar when someone took his radio. \nThe hot line was a direct communication link between the leaders of the Soviet Union  and the United States. The hot line had an important purpose: to prevent accidental war between the two competitors during the period known as the Cold War. The American president and the Soviet leader were able to communicate directly and immediately on the hot line.", "id": "high20187.txt"}
