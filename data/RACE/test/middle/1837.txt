John got married six months ago, and like many young people these days, they are struggling  to make a home when the cost of living is very high. The Koses took a 2-week course for $ 280 at a night school. Now they build all their furniture and make repairs around the house.\nJim Hatfield has three boys and his wife died. He has a full-time job at home as well as in a shoe-making factory. Last month, he received a car repair bill for $420. \"I was very upset about it. Now I've finished a car repair course. I should be able to fix the car myself. \"\nJohn and Jim are not unusual people. Most families in the country are doing everything they can save money so they can fight the high cost of living. If you want to become a \"do-it-yourself\", you can go to DIY classes. And for those who don't have time to take a course, there are books that tell you how to do things yourself.", "id": "middle1837.txt"}
