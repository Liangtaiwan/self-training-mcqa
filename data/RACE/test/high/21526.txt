My Dad was a fisherman, and he loved the sea. He had his own boat, but it was hard making a living on the sea. He worked hard and would stay out until he caught enough to feed the family. Not just enough for our family, but also for his Mom and Dad and the other kids that were still at home.\nDad was a big man, and he was strong from pulling the nets and fighting the sea for his catch. When you got close to him, you smelled the ocean.\nWhen the weather was bad he would drive me to school. He would pull right up in front, and it seemed like everybody would be standing around and watching. Then he would lean over and give me a big kiss on the cheek and tell me to be a good boy. It was so embarrassing for me. Here I was twelve years old, and my Dad would lean over and kiss me good-bye!\nI remembered the day I thought I was too old for a good-bye kiss. When we got to the school and came to a stop, he had his usual big smile. He started to lean toward me, but  _ It was the first time I had ever talked to him that way, and he had this surprised look on his face.\nI said, \"Dad, I'm too old for a good-bye kiss. I'm too old for any kind of kiss.\" My Dad looked at me for the longest time, and his eyes started to tear up. I had never seen him cry. He turned and looked at the windshield . \"You're right,\" he said. \"You are a big boy...a man. I won't kiss you any more.\nIt wasn't long after that when my Dad went to sea and never came back.\nGuys, you don't know what I would give to have my Dad give me just one more kiss on the cheek ...  to feel his rough old face ...  to smell the ocean on him ...  to feel his arm around my neck. I wish I had been a man then. If I had been a man, I would be a man. I would never have told my Dad I was too old for a good-bye kiss.", "id": "high21526.txt"}
