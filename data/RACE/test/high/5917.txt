Therefore, they spend all day studying without time to relax.\nHowever, not all students can go to top universities even if they work very hard. Students are pressurized by parents and teachers who are just concerned about their studies and exam scores while ignoring their hobbies and individual differences. As a result, students are forces to work harder and harder. Furthermore, there is pressure coming from students themselves. They realize they have a slim chance of getting into a top university as competition is fierce. So, they put a lot of stress on themselves and stay in a nervous state day after day. If they keep it up,   they'll suffer illnesses; both psychological and physical.\nWhat students need is relaxation. This doesn't mean that they should give up their ambitions and stop studying hard. It means \"work while you work, play while you play\". If you can do this, you will improve your health greatly. You'll feel yourself suddenly fresh, just like recovering from a terrible illness. You'll find that your studies are not a burden  anymore.", "id": "high5917.txt"}
