As I was talking about how I was studying English, the foreigner seemed to be very surprised, gently shaking his head and saying \"You don't say!\"\nI was confused, and I thought, \"Perhaps this is not a right thing to talk about.\" Then I said to him, \"Well, shall we talk about the Great Wall? Have you ever visited it?\"\n\"Certainly! Everyone back home will laugh at me if I leave here without seeing it. The Great Wall is wonderful! \" \"Yes, it is one of the wonders in the world. And people of many countries have come to visit it.\" As I went on telling him more about it, he stopped me again, \"You don't say!\"\nI couldn't help asking, \"Why couldn't I talk about it?\"\n\"Well, I didn't stop you talking about it,\" he answered, greatly surprised.\n\"Didn't you say 'You don't say!'?\" I asked again.\nHearing this, the foreigner laughed loudly. He began to explain, \"'You don't say!' means 'Really'. Perhaps you know little about English idioms .\"\nWow! How foolish I was! Since then I have been careful with English idioms.", "id": "middle411.txt"}
