Is it because they are lazy?\nOf course not.In fact, the difference in spelling was created by Noah Webster(1758--1843) .He is a teacher who reformed English to make American identity stronger.Linguists celebrated his 250th birthday on October 16,2008.After the Revolutionary War(1775--1783) , Webster believed that Americans should have their own dictionary, rather than rely on British versions.He dropped the British \"u\" in some words.And he changed \"centre\" into \"center\" for children to learn English by spelling words more like they sounded.\nWebster wasn't shy about expressing his opinions.In defining  preposterous  (unreasonable) , he wrote: \"A Republican government in the hands of females is preposterous.\"\nWebster spent 28 years on the project before completing the 70,000 -word dictionary in 1828 with his American - style spellings.He also added local words.His dictionary was widely used in schools.Linguists believed it helped a new nation achieve unity and cultural independence at a time when most were focused on political freedom.\n\"He was the shaper of our language and the shaper of American identity,\" said Joshua Kendall, who is working on a biography about Webster.\"He at last got us united through our language.", "id": "high18311.txt"}
