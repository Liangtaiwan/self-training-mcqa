Early humans found that the regular movements of the sun,the earth,the moon,and the stars made good ways to measure time. The rising and setting of the sun were used to distinguish  day from night.\nBut,eventually,people needed to tell time more accurately,or exactly. So,by using the sun's position in the sky,they divided the day into dawn,morning,midday and evening.\nThen it was noted that the sun cast a changing shadow as it moved across the sky. Time could be told more accurately by setting up a stick and marking the positions of the sun's shadow. It was the ancient Greeks who divided each position of this \"sundial \" into hours.\nBut the sun doesn't always shine. So,for the past 6,000 years,many other ways of keeping time have been tried. Slowburning candles were divided into hours,and the hourglass was invented. When all the sand in the top of an hourglass has shifted to the bottom,an hour has passed.\nLater,the pendulum ,with its regular backandforth movement of weights,was used to move the hands on a clock. Pendulums are still used in grandfather clocks.\nToday,even more accurate clocks are in use,such as batteryoperated quartz clocks ,digital clocks,and clocks run by electrical tuning forks and tiny atoms. These atomic clocks are the most accurate clocks ever invented. The exact time can be kept to within 1 second a century.", "id": "high12730.txt"}
