Check out some other Best Picture nominees to see if you missed any of last year's top Hollywood films.\nThe Imitation Game\nThis historical thriller is about British computer scientist, Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), the father of artificial intelligence. At the start of World War II, Turing was asked to join a select team of mathematical geniuses to decode  the system the Nazis used to send military messages. Besides the actual breaking of the code, Cumberbatch's portrayal of Turing's personality, a mixture of decency and shyness, is also a highlight of the movie.\nBirdman\nThis dark comedy film is about how Riggan Thomson, a faded star once famous for his superhero roles, struggles to regain fame. American actor Michael Keaton, 63, who has a similar experience to Thomson's, plays the leading role.\nSelma\nA stellar cast  including talk show queen Oprah Winfrey may be one reason to see Selma. But that the film focuses on Martin Luther King Jr.'s struggle for civil rights also makes it worth viewing. Based on the 1965 Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches, the film is a chronicle  of King's (David Oyelowo) campaign for political rights for African-American people.\nThe Theory of Everything\nWe know English theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking for his significant scientific discoveries, especially his black hole theories. This biographical film reveals the scientist's (played by Eddie Redmayne) secret romantic relationship with Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones), whom he meets and falls in love with at Cambridge and who later becomes his first wife.\nBoyhood\nAmerican Director Richard Linklater did an experiment in this film, using the same cast for 12 years to record a boy's growth. In two and a half hours, we see Mason, a Texas boy from a divorced family, grow from 6-year-old boy to a freshman in college.", "id": "high10846.txt"}
