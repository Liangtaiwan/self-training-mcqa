She also taught me from an early age to be suspicious of strange men, especially when they give you presents. One day, a \"nice man\" bearing flowers managed to steal 20 euros from her purse, while she was holding it in her hands. \"He said he was collecting for a church charity so I pulled out a euro,\" she explains, \"He said 'no, no, that's too much' and offered to look in my purse to find a smaller coin.

Apollo Robbins, a stage pickpocket, said smart move, like moving your hand in an arc   motion rather than a straight line, is another popular strategy employed by tricksters.\nAt last, it should be pointed out that most thefts are opportunistic. The skill level of most thieves is far less than you think. But they are opportunistic enough to keep up with new technology.", "id": "high11181.txt"}
