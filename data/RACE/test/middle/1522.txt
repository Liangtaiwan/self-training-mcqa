You may be able to save 100% of your money. Does that mean you should? Not at all. The best way to develop good saving habits is to make saving a regular part of your life, along with spending.\nHere is the rule you should remember: save before spending. Whenever some money gets into your hands, from a job or your pocket money or whatever, take your savings out immediately, before spending any of the money. The beauty of this system is that if you take away your savings, you are free to spend the rest.\nHere are some more suggestions on how to successfully get into the saving habit from teens. Let's see!\nTony,13: I put my money in a bank instead of my wallet, so the money is not there. And I have to take an extra step to get it.\nBill,14: When considering a major purchase , wait a week or so, at least. This will help you make sure if you still want it, and the price might go down.\nDick, 13: Carry very little money always. You can't spend money if you don't have it. A cake would be nice, but without a dollar, you can't get it. Little things like that really add up quickly.\nSteve,16: I used to be weak when it came to money. I bought something whenever I went into a store. I'm glad I'm not that person now. I taught myself discipline by keeping a $20 bill in my pocket while waking around the mall all day and not buying anything. Now I have no strong wish to buy things when I go into a store. It works for me.\nThese ideas should help you get started.
