Jane has 50 customers, and on cold mornings when she couldn't ride her bike, it took her more than an hour to make her rounds.\nAs she collected her papers and put them into a big canvas bag, Jane regretted that she hadn't finished her math homework the night before. There was still time. She'd hurry with the papers and finish the math before breakfast.\nLess than an hour later, Jane was nearly finished. She had only five customers to go.
