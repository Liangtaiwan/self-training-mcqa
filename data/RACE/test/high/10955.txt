Howver, in the last ten years, when many different kinds of music have established themselves on the pop scene, more and more stars have come from other countries.\nPop music changes all the time and new stars appear and become famous. For a musician to stay popular and still produced good, original music over a long period of time, is a sign of true star.\nMost stars start their careers in a simple way---- playing in unknown night clubs or dance-hall where people want to dance to the music, not listen to it. They may have continued doing this for many years untill they get a \"break\"---- a chance to perform in a well -known place or get a recording contract. To become a star is the aim of every singer or musician and the dream of many a pop-crazy teenager.\nHowever a group or star makes it to the top, they can be sure that their lives will change once they are successful.

Despite great public success, life at the top can be very lonely.", "id": "high10955.txt"}
