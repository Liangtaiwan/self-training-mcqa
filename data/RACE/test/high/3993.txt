It was written more than three hundred years ago. Even now people still agree with him. No one can live a completely lonely life. Without other people, life will become empty and sad. We all need to have friends.\nFor some of us, although making friends is not difficult, feeling shy, we may not want to make the first move. It is also difficult at times to keep the friends we already have.\nThere are many books about friendship, but Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People, written in 1936, is the most famous. This \"how to\" book about getting along with other people became a best seller. It was later put into 28 languages.\nDale Carnegie's advice seems to be simple, but can his advice help you? Do you need to change the way you act? Here is the list of advice from his book:\nBe friendly and polite.\nAlways greet with a smile. Begin with \"Excuse me\" or \"Would you please\" when you want to ask somebody. Remember to say \"Thank you\" and try to be as helpful as you can.\nGo out of your way to be nice.\nFind some time to do special things for other people. Making some soup for a sick neighbour may seem like a little thing to you, but it will make your neighbor feel a lot better.\nRemember names.\nThey say that the sweetest music to a person's ears is the sound of his or her own name.\nBe open-minded.\nTry to understand other people's ways and ideas and learn something from them.\nListen patiently.\nWhen someone is talking to you, look at him or her, listen carefully and say something when necessary.", "id": "high3993.txt"}
