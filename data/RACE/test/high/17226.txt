In the 1990s, they wanted to know your website. These days, having a web address is almost as important as a street address.

The Web is filled with all kinds of free services and all it takes is some time and creativity.\n       Think of your home page as the starting point of your website.

Pictures, texts, and links to other websites follow.\n       Before you start building your site, do some planning. Think about whom the site is for and what you want to say. Next, gather up the material that you want to put on the site. Draw a rough layout on a sheet of paper.\n       While there are no rules you have to follow, there are a few things to keep in mind:\n       Start simply. If you are too ambitious at the beginning, you may never get the site off the ground. You can always add to your site.\nLess is better. Most people don't like to read a lot of text online. Break it into small pieces.\n       Smaller is better. Most people connect to the Internet with a modem. Since it can take a long time to download large image files, keep the file sizes small.\n       Have the rights. Don't put any material on your site unless you are sure you can do it legally.
