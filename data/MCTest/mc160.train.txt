The first grade class went on a bus to visit a farm. The farm was a long ways from their
school. The farm was also far away from any other farms or houses. The farmers who lived
there were the Nixon family. They grew corn. Sometimes when the weather was right, they
would plant wheat, too. The fields were so large that the class could not see where they
ended. Mr. Nixon gave all of the children a long ride in the fields on his tractor. The
Nixon family also had a lot of farm animals. In the red barn next to their home, they kept
a few cows and horses. Everyone fed hay to some of the cows. The farmers got milk from
their cows. Some of the class got small bottles of fresh milk to take home with them. All
the kids got to ride on the big brown horses the Nixons had. They went up into the nearby
hills, where they could look down on the farm below. Around the farmyard there were many
goats and chickens, who wandered around as they wished. The Nixon children liked to play
with their goats, feed them peanut shells and pet them, like the first grade kids did with
their dogs and cats. The smallest tried to bump the children with their hard heads and
tiny horns! When it was almost dark, the school kids got back on the bus to go home. They
were a little sad to leave the fun life of the farm children. But they brought back
stories for all the rest of the school to hear.

I used to be afraid of butterflies!  It is true!  Once, my mom took me to Seattle.  There,
we went to a special place.  We went to the zoo!

I saw lots of animals at the zoo.  I saw bears.  I saw tigers.  I saw apes.  I saw
monkeys.  I saw snakes.  I loved seeing all these animals.  They made me happy.

We even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they didn't even scare me.  In
fact, I like bugs.  But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where there
were lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place.  You could buy sugar water
to feed them and they could land on you.  My mom and brother were so excited to go in, but
I was scared.  I wasn't sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying
everywhere.  My mom said I would be okay.  My brother said I would be okay.  They said
butterflies were nice and beautiful.  They said they would not hurt me.  So I went in the
room.

Guess what?  I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door!
The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me
to stop.  He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.  I said I
was sorry, but I was scared.  He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of
there!

I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.

Since then, they would tease me about being afraid.  They would try and get me to not be
afraid.  Last year for my birthday, mom bought me a butterfly book.  She bought one for my
brother, too.  I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and find
butterflies with my brother.  It became really fun to do.  Once, a butterfly landed on me
and I laughed.  I liked it.  It tickled me.  It did not hurt me.  Now, I like butterflies!

Chocolate was a box turtle.  Lauren found her one day on the side of the road, hiding in

Mary was a little girl who loved to sew. She liked to sew dresses, shirts, and skirts but
Mary hated to sew quilts. She didn't like anything about sewing quilts and blankets

sew but instead of going outside to play she ran into her room and cried. Mary was very
sad that she couldn't sew any more. Soon her friends came over to see why Mary hadn't come
over to play like her father said she would. When they saw her crying on her bed they had
to think of a way to cheer her up. Billy said that maybe they could let her sew at their
houses. Abby thought it was a great idea. So then all Mary's friends bought sewing things

pull out some tissues. She felt a strange  piece of paper. She pulled it out and there was
the invitation to Allison's party. It had gotten mixed up in her papers in her desk. She

A boy named Eduardo in a far away place is thinking about a girl he loves.

He is cold. It is snowing where he lives. He lives in Argentina.

It's warm where she lives in Hawaii. She eats fresh fruit.  Her shower is outdoors under
the warm sun as red birds fly around her. It is nice, but she misses him.

She remembers he is very pretty. She wondered if he would really love her always,  because
she is older.

He didn't care. Eduardo was poor, so he could not visit her. 

Maybe a time machine would help!! She can give back her birthdays! But she didn't want to

said, "close your eyes! Then remember the most happy you have ever felt! Let go of any
thing that feels like clouds. Imagine puppies hugging you, and kitties purring with
you. Imagine you are eating chocolate ice cream!

As long as you remember how to be happy  you can ALWAYS be as young as Eduardo! And you
can think of GREAT ways you can see him again!"

It worked! She had an idea. Someone in a place called MR was buying stories that people
wrote. She wrote one about her & Eduardo!

It paid for her airplane ride. Wow.

Then they were together again. Hugging each other in happiness, they said, "Thank you
everyone,  for helping us!"

Once upon a time, there was a boy named Freddy.   And Freddy loved his mom very much, and
his mom loved him very much too.  One day, Freddy went outside to ride his bike.  On the
way out, his mother told him, "Remember to wear your helmet," and Freddy grabbed his
helmet and met his friends outside.  When he was putting on his helmet, his friends told
him, "Helmets are for girls!  You're not cool if you wear a helmet!"  Freddy thought about
what his mom told him, but he wanted to be cool like his friends, and he took off his
helmet.

Freddy and his friends went on a long adventure, and they rode all the way to the top of
the largest hill in their neighborhood.  Looking down, Freddy was scared.  He had never
ridden down this hill before.  His friends said, "What are you, scared?"  Freddy did not
want to come off as scared.  He hopped on his bicycle, and down he went.  Freddy started
speeding up, going very, very fast.  He pressed his brakes, but oh no, his brakes weren't
working.  Freddy, speeding down the hill, did not know what to do.  He got to the end of
the hill and slammed right into a tree.  He awoke the next day in the hospital.

At the hospital, his mother was there.  Freddy opened his eyes and told his mom the whole

helmet.  His mom gave him a big kiss on the forehead, and Freddy knew his mother was right
in the beginning.  She didn't have to say it.  In the end, Freddy learned that it's

Late in the evening, the wind blew hard around the little house. The sound of the wind is
like someone crying. It made the old woman nervous. She had not been getting much sleep
lately, but with the wind making the spooky noise, she didn't know what else to do but lie
down and try to rest a little.

Once she lay down to try to sleep, many memories of her life in the little house kept her
mind busy. She still was having trouble falling asleep. She remembered being a little girl
and her dad putting the finishing touches on the house. Her mom loved the big kitchen, and
she and her younger sister had their own room in the back.

It was in this, her old bedroom, that she was trying to sleep. The crying sound got
louder. It didn't seem like it was outside. It sounded like it was coming from the other
side of the bed. When she turned and looked, she saw her younger sister. She still looked
five years old. The old woman couldn't remember her any other way, as she had died from a
sickness at age five.

"What's wrong?" she asked her sister. "I miss you. I am so lonely," answered the little
girl, who was so thin you could see through her. The old lady closed her eyes and reached
for her sister. That is how they found her the next day, holding her pillow and smiling.

"She died in her sleep." "It is best that way."

Bailey and her friend Kara were bored one Saturday.  It was a hot summer day.  They didn't
want to stay inside any longer but they didn't know what to do.  They were tired of
watching TV inside.  Suddenly, Kara had an idea.  She said, "Bailey, we could make some
money."  "How?," asked Bailey.  "Well, it is hot outside," said Kara. "People are thirsty
out there.  We could make money by making some lemonade and iced tea and have people pay
for it."  "That is a great idea," answered Bailey, "let's do it!" Kara had made some iced
tea with her mom earlier that day.  She asked her mom permission to use it.  Her mom said
yes.  She and Kara made two pitchers of lemonade.  They got a cooler full of ice and made
a sign so people knew what was for sale.  Kara's mom helped them get a table and chairs
and set up out on the corner in their neighborhood.  It was so hot out that people who saw
their stand came to buy drinks right away. Their first visitors to their stand were their
friends, Abby and Molly.  In a half hour, they had to close their stand. They were all
out of lemonade and iced tea.  They had made a lot of money. They split the money and each
got ten dollars.  It was a great day.

The best afternoon I ever had with my grandfather was when we went down to the river and
fished.  It was a hot July day, and I was bored. My grandfather was sitting in the
backyard, reading. "Hey, you look like you need some fun," he said.  "Want to go fishing?"
I said sure, and he went to the garage.  He came out with two poles, some hooks, and some
fishing line. Everything was in pieces, but he showed me how to put it all together.  I
asked if we needed worms, and he said no. Then, we set off to the river.

It was only about ten blocks to the river, but walking along past the library and the
store, he told me about how he used to go fishing with his friend Steve. They used to
catch catfish, then take them home so that their mothers could cook them for dinner.  When
we got to the park at the river, my grandfather went right to the bank, then turned and
walked up along the side of the river until we were off in the shade under the trees right
at the edge of the park. There, he taught me how to throw my line in the water. Then we
sat down to wait. While we were fishing, my grandfather told me lots of stories about what
he and Steve did as kids. We didn't have any worms, so we never caught any fish, but
sitting there as he told me stories made it a great afternoon.

Tim Goes To The Beach

Today was exciting. Tim's mom was taking him and his little sisters, Rebecca and Georgia,
to the beach! They were going to go swimming. Then they were also going to have a picnic
lunch on the beach. After their picnic lunch, Tim's mom was going to light a campfire and
they were going to eat toasted marshmallows.

Tim and his mom and his two little sisters hopped into the van. His little sisters were
both very blonde and pretty little girls. They were only 4 years old. Because they lived
in the city, they had a short drive to get to the beach. To pass the time, Tim played Eye
Spy with his mother as they drove for a bit. Once they had gotten bored with Eye Spy, they
played 20 Questions. Tim would think of something, and his mother would ask him questions
to try and guess what it was.

When they got to the beach, it was warm, and sunny. The salt water was warm, and the waves
lapped up on the shore. It made a lovely noise. It also felt great on Tim's toes, and his
little sisters giggled when the waves hit them.

When they had had their fill of swimming, Tim's mom had them sit down to a nice
dinner. They ate and ate. They ate macaroni salad. Then they ate some cold chicken. They
also had lemon pie for dessert.

Joey got a German Shepherd for his birthday present. He had never had any pets before, but
was always excited to see the other dogs and cats in his neighborhood. Since his birthday
was in June, he spent a lot of time playing outside with his new puppy, which he named

not let anything get in the way of her performances. It was important for her parents for

John thought about things that he liked to do.

Well, for one, he liked baseball. Compared to his friends, he was very good at the
sport. He didn't even have to practice that much. He remembered that he once hit the ball
so hard that it flew out of the park. Home run!

He was also a fan of basketball. He enjoyed watching people on television pull off crazy
tricks like slam dunking (but he didn't really like all of the passes). He wasn't quite
that good yet, but he was pretty good at making shots from the three point line. He knew
that if he kept practicing, he would be really great someday.

Finally, he loved football. Unlike baseball and basketball, he didn't play football
himself, but he was drawn to the games. He got a kick out of sitting in the stands,
cheering on his team and friends. He once cheered so loud that he could barely speak at
