My host family lived in a huge house I could only describe as a \"castle\".In Germany I had lived in a small apartment together with my mom. Soon I found out that the \"castle\" was actually rather small in our neighborhood.\nEverybody there was very friendly and polite. They greeted you when they were walking by at least 3 feet away from you. They must not have seen a German au pair before, for most people I met asked me all kinds of questions about Germany. I enjoyed answering their various strange questions. I made a lot of friends and I started to hang out with them.\nOf course, there were a number of new things, and it took me the whole year to find them all out. I never got homesick. Perhaps it was because I did not have too many negative experiences and felt loved and welcomed there.\nHowever, I had _ some painful experience back in Germany. I was frustrated by the way people would run me over and not even say \"Sorry.\" Taking up my studies at the TU-Dresden, I felt lonely. Everybody here seemed to be withdrawn  and I missed everything I had in Cincinnati. Germany was so \"cold\". I found it so much harder to make new friends. After six months I got a roommate and only two good friends. I also flew back to Cincinnati several times for long periods. I felt that without those visits I was not able to make it.\nNow I am over this German culture shock. It almost took me an entire year. I am still going back and forward between Dresden and Cincinnati four times a year.", "id": "high14475.txt"}
