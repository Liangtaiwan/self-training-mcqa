British scientists said last Wednesday human may have underestimated  the woolly creatures. They could be much smarter than we think.\nResearchers at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge, southern. England, have shown that animals have a good memory system and are extremely good at recognizing faces--which they think is a sure sign of intelligence.\nBehavioral scientist Keith Kendrick and his friends trained 20 sheep to recognize and distinguish  25 pairs of sheep faces and used electrodes  to measure their brain activity, which showed they could remember 50 faces for up to two years.\n\"If they can do that with faces, the fact is that they have to have reasonable intelligence, otherwise, what is the point of having a system for remembering anything else,\" Kendrick said in an interview.\nSo hours of seemingly mindless eating grass may not be so mindless after all.\nKendrick believes sheep got their reputation as dumb animals because they live in large groups and do not appear to have much ind\nividuality and are frightened of just about everything.\nAll animals, including humans, once they are frightened don't tend to show signs of intelligent action,\" he explained.\nIn research reported in the science journal Nature, Kendrick and his team showed that sheep, like humans, have a specialized system in the brain, which allows them to distinguish between many different faces that look extremely similar.\n\"The most important findings of the study is that they are able, both from a behavioral point of view and from looking at the way the brain is organized, to remember a large number of faces of individuals for a very long time,\" said Kendrick. \"It is a very strange system. They are showing similar abilities in many ways to humans. \"", "id": "high7640.txt"}
