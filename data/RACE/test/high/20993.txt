The peacock lived in a tree on the bank of the stream in which the tortoise had his home, and every day the peacock danced near the stream and displayed his gay plumage for the amusement of his friend. \nUnfortunately, one day a bird-catcher caught the peacock and was about to take him away to the market. The unhappy bird begged his captor to allow him to say goodbyeto his friend -- the tortoise. The bird-catcher agreed and took the peacock to the tortoise, who was greatly astonished when he saw his friend become a captive. The tortoise asked the bird-catcher to let the peacock go, but the bird-catcher laughed at his request, saying that was his livelihood. The tortoise then said, \"If I give you a handsome present, will you let my friend go?\" \"Certainly,\" answered the bird-catcher. So the tortoise dived into the water and in a few seconds came up with a handsome pearl. To the bird-catcher's astonishment, the tortoise handed it to him. This was beyond his expectation, and he let the peacock go immediately.\nA short time later, the  _ man came back and told the tortoise that he thought he had not been paid enough for the release of his friend, and threatened that unless he received another pearl which matched the first one, he would again catch the peacock. The tortoise, who had already advised his friend to go to a distant place on being set free, was greatly enraged at the greed of this man. \"Well,\" said the tortoise, \"if you insist on having another pearl like that one, give it to me and I will fish you out an exact match for it.\" The cupidity of the bird-catcher prevented his reasoning that \"one in the hand is equal to two in the bed of the stream\", and he quickly gave the pearl to the wily tortoise, who swam out with it, saying, \"I am no fool to take one and give two!\" and disappeared immediately, leaving the bird-catcher to be sorry for his greed.", "id": "high20993.txt"}
