While any of these statements might be true, they are practically impossible to prove scientifically. Still, I was struck by a report which concluded that today's children are significantly more anxious than children in the 1950s. In fact, the analysis showed, normal children aged 9 to 17 exhibit a higher level of anxiety today than children who were treated for mental illness 50 years ago.\nWhy are America's kids so stressed? The report cites two main causes: increasing physical isolation  brought on by high divorce rates and less involvement in community, among other things and a growing perception that the world is a more dangerous place.\nConsidering that we can't turn the clock back, adults can still do plenty to help the next generation.\nAt the top of the list is nurturing  a better appreciation of the limits of individualism. No child is an island. Strengthening social ties helps build communities and protect individuals against stress.\nTo help kids build stronger connections with others, you can pull the plug on TVs and computers. Your family will thank you later. They will have more time for facetoface relationships, and they will get more sleep.\nLimit the amount of virtual  violence your children are exposed to. It's not just video games and movies; children see a lot of murder and crime on the local news.\nKeep your expectations for your children reasonable. Many highly successful people never attended Harvard or Yale.\nMake exercise part of your daily routine. It will help you cope with your own anxieties and provide a good model for your kids. Sometimes anxiety is unavoidable. But it doesn't have to ruin your life.", "id": "high14089.txt"}
