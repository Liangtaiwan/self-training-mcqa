Ecologists pointed out that a forest of tall buildings in a city often overburdens public transportation and parking lots.\nSkyscrapers are also consumers and wasters of electric power. In one recent year, the addition of 17 million square feet of skyscrapers office space in New York City raised the peak daily demand for electricity by 120,000 kilowatts--enough to supply the entire city of Albany, prefix = st1 /New York, for a day.\nGlass-walled skyscrapers can be especially wasteful. The heat loss ( or gain) through a wall of half-inch plate glass is more than ten times that through a typical brick wall filled with insulation   board. To lessen the strain on heating and air-conditioning equipment, builders of skyscrapers have begun to use double-glazed panels of glass, and reflective glasses coated with silver or gold mirror films that reduce glare  as well as heat gain.\nHowever, mirror-walled skyscrapers raise the temperature of the surrounding air and affect neighboring buildings.                \nSkyscrapers put a strain on a city's sanitation facilities ,too. If fully occupied, the two World Trade Center towers in New York City would alone produce 2.25 million gallons of wastes each year-as much a city the size of Stanford,Connecticut, which has a population of more than 109,000.\nSkyscrapers also affect television reception, block bird flyways and air traffic, In Boston in the late 1960's, some people even feared that shadows from skyscrapers would kill the grass on Boston Common. Still ,people continue to build skyscrapers for all the reasons that they have always built them-personal pride and the desire of owners to have the largest possible amount of space to rent.", "id": "high20015.txt"}
