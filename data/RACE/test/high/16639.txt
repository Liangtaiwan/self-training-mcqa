Middle school is going to use a new way to decide who the top students are. The best students won't only have high marks. They will also be kids who don't dye  their hair, smoke or drink. The following are some of the new rules.\nTell the truth. Have you ever copied others' work in an exam? Don't do it again if you did it before! That's not something an honest student should do. If you have played computer games for two hours in your room, don't tell your parents you have done your homework.\nDo more at school. Good students love animals and care for other people. April is a bird-loving month in China. Did your school do anything to celebrate? If so, you should join it! In this way, you can learn more about animals and how to protect them. When more people work together, you can get more fun. Have you ever quarreled with your teammates when your basketball team lost? Only working together can make your team stronger. Be friendly to the people you are with. Try to think of others, not only yourself. \nBe open to new ideas. Have you ever thought that people could live on the moon? Maybe you'll discover the truth someday. Don't look down on new ideas. Everyone's ideas are important. You should welcome them, because new ideas make life better for everyone.\nProtect yourself. Has anyone ever taken money from one of your classmates? Don't let it happen to you. If you have to go home late, you should let your parents know. \nUse the Internet carefully. The Internet can be very useful for our studies. But some things on the Internet aren't for kids, so try to look at Web pages that are good for you. You can use the Web for fun or homework. Can you find any good websites for children? Here are some.\nhttp: // kids. eastday. com; http: // www. chinakids. net.com; http:// www. cycnet. com.", "id": "high16639.txt"}
