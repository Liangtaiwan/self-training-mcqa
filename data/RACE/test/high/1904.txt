There, husbands and children are not allowed. Why would a woman want to take a vacation without her family? Some women say they need time to be alone.\nAt Mother's Camp a woman has room to herself. She can sleep, read or watch TV, and no one will bother her. No children will ask,\"Mom, what's for dinner?\" No husband will say, \"Oh, dear, I can't find any clean socks.\"In fact almost 50% of women in the United States work outside the home. Many of them work full-time and then come home to a second job-taking care of their homes and families. These working women say one of their biggest problems is housework.\nIn the United States, working wives do about 75% of the housework. Many of their husbands say they want to help. But then they burn the rice or they can't find the pans. They ask so many questions that their wives decide it is easier to do the job themselves.\nSome women go to Mother's Camp just to get a break from housework. For two days they don't cook, they don't clean, they don't look after their children and husbands. What do they do? They enjoy warm, sunny weather, walking, swimming or boating in a clear blue lake and sing songs around the campfire. They relax away from home. They have a really wonderful vacation at Mother's Camp.", "id": "high1904.txt"}
