Several years ago, one weekend Bruno and his family did a major house cleanup and then donated several bags of unneeded items to the local Goodwill store. \"After all were done, I looked around and realized that I still had too much stuff\", says Bruno, \" _ \" That realization prompted the 39-year-old father of three to try an experiment, \"The 100Thing Challenge\".\nWith the goal of breaking free of what he calls a \"bad habit of consumerism , Bruno was determined to live for one year with just 100 personal items. He cut down his possessions to 94 items, including a Bible, laptop, guitar, wedding ring, car and clothes. He created some guidelines for the experiment since his wife and daughters did not participate, familyshared and household items did not count as personal items. He also grouped together some basic things such as underwear and socks. Bruno began blogging about his new lifestyle and eventually wrote a book, The 100 Thing Challenge: How I Got Rid of Almost Everything, Remade My Life, and Regained My Soul.\nSince completing the experiment, Bruno has continued to live by the motto: reduce, refuse, and rearrange and maintains just 110 personal things. \" Nearly three years of living with a minimal amount of personal possessions, I'm no longer in the habit of consuming for the sake of consumption  ,\" he wrote in his blog last week, \"That has freed me up for all sorts of better endeavors   than shopping--like spending time with family and writing a book and planning for business opportunities.\"\nBruno's project has also inspired others to live minimally, many of whom post their own 100 Thing Challenge updates on YouTube. \"The reality is that the 100 Thing Challenge is surprisinglyeasy\", says Bruno, \"I'm  not saying there were no challenges or disappointments. I miss some things, but not that much. Frankly, it's far easier to live with less stuff than with excessive trash.\"", "id": "high3586.txt"}
