It seems as if we can't get enough of spending money through countless online clicks today. Following are some of the incredible things that you can buy online!\n1) Parents\n51-year-old Michael Amatrudo from Connecticut put a posting on Craig list in 2009 to sell his elderly parents, asking for $155 in return.\n2) Chewing Gum\nBidding for Britney Spears' chewing gum reached $14,000 in 2004. The pop star's half-eaten sandwich also went for over $500.\n3) Kidney Stone\nStar Trek actor William Shatner sold his kidney stone for $20,000 when he put it up for sale online to see how much a piece of him was worth. He ended up giving the money to charity.\n4) An Imaginary Friend\nThis imaginary guy went (or might still be going) by the name of Jon Malipieman and was sold on eBay for $3,000 by a man who claimed:\n\"My imaginary friend Jon Malipieman is getting too old for me now. I am now 27 and I feel I am growing out of him. He is very friendly. Along with him, I will send you what he likes and dislikes, his favorite things to do and his personal self portrait.\"\n5) Souls\nThe website demonical.com is probably the creepiest site I have ever visited. You can sell your own soul or buy the souls of people such as Fidel Castro and Woody Allen (both selling for $950). Bill Gate, whoever that is, has his soul for sale at $1,300 while Michael Jacobsen's soul is being sold for $3000.\n6) A Rock That Looks Like Meat\nThe screen shot from eBay tells us that people are bidding over $1 million for this \"naturally formed bbq pork rock\". Absolute madness.", "id": "high10115.txt"}
