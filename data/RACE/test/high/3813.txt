Das is in charge of a kitchen in Vrindaban. The town is about a three-hour drive from India's capital, New Delhi. Das gets to work at 3:00 a.m. Thirty workers are already working to make tens of thousands of rounds of bread. It will be brought to 1,516 schools in and around Vrindaban.\nA Growing Problem\nGoing to school is difficult for more than 13 million children in India. They must go to work instead, or go hungry. That's why India began the Mid-Day Meal Scheme, the largest school-lunch program in the world. A free lunch encourages children to come to school and gives them the energy they need for learning. The program began in the 1960s.\nThe kitchen in Vrindaban is run by the Akshaya Patra Foundation. It is one of the lunch program's biggest partners. \"Just $11.50 can feed one child for an entire year,\" said Madhu Sridhar, president of the Akshaya Patra Foundation.\nLunch Is Served!\nThe Akshaya Patra food truck arrives at Gopalgarh Primary School. Since the program started, the number of underweight children has gone down. The children get foods they need -- as long as they finish what's on their plates.", "id": "high3813.txt"}
