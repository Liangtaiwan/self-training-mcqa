The frame was made of silver, with an elegant flower design in one corner. The photograph was taken in March 1939 on their wedding day. Emily looked very happy, and Gordon looked rather alarmed.  A few months later, he was killed in action in North Africa. I received the photograph when my aunt Mabel died.\n   I'm a student at Edinburgh University and I live in an old Edwardian house.  At the end of last term, I packed a large bag and a small bag and set off for London, where I was planning to catch the Eurostar train to Paris. Minutes after getting off the train at Kings Cross Station, I realized that I'd left the small bag in the overhead luggage rack. I ran back to the train, but it had already left the platform.\n   This all happened several months ago, and I had become resigned to the loss of my most precious possession. Then last week, something extraordinary happened. I logged onto the site Bay and looked for a silver photo frame and I found it ! The photo of my great grandparents was on Bay !\n   I called the person who was advertising it. He was a little suspicious at first, and told me that he had bought it from a stall at an antique market. After we talked for a while, he asked if there was any way I could prove it was mine. All I could think of was that the photo was taken in March 1939. He opened the frame and made sure that this date was written by hand on the back of the photograph.\n  \"It ' s definitely yours. \" he said.  \"Come and get it ! \"\n5(11)", "id": "high18339.txt"}
