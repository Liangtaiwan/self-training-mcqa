For example, when you are in England you must not lift your soup plate to your mouth. This is very impolite. But when you are in Japan this is completely normal. Lifting your plate to your mouth in Japan is a traditional way of drinking your soup. And also in Japan you don't have to worry about making a noise when you drink it. It just shows that you really like the food! But it is not the same in Britain, so you shouldn't make a noise when eating there.\nIn Britain, people don't put their hands or arms on the table during the meal. But in Mexico, guests keep their hands on the table all the time. In fact, you should watch what your hands do very carefully. In Arab countries, it is impolite when you eat with your left hand, so don't do it!\nIn all the cultures it is impolite to speak when you are eating.\nIn Ukraine you should not start eating first; you should wait for all the others to start eating with you. You also have to say \"please\" and \"thank you\" every time you ask for and get something. If you don't like some food, don't make faces and don't say: \"Yuk! I hate that!\" \nThe best way to avoid making mistakes in other countries is to watch the host and try to do as he does.", "id": "high18509.txt"}
