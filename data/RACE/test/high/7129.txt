But while our daily routines rely on clocks that tell us the time, science is discovering that our well-being is influenced by a very different kind of timepiece. Circadian rhythms---the human body's own internal clock---have a powerful influence on our health and behaviour. _ are programmed from birth and control functions ranging from temperature and blood pressure to sleep patterns.\nIn recent years researchers have also discovered that this built-in mechanism can influence everything from the way we react to medicines to how well we learn music.\nThe latest example, from experts at Harvard University in the US, shows that the human body clock can even dictate whether or not we are likely to tell the truth. Researchers found it was easier for people to fib  in the afternoon because, as they were tired, the self control that would normally prevent them from lying started to break down. Tiredness made it harder to resist the temptation to tell lies---especially if it meant they got a financial reward at the end.\n\"The body clock has a great effect on us all,\" says Professor Jim Horne from the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University. \"Most people tend to feel good around late morning and then decline in the early afternoon. But the time most of us will feel our sharpest is between 6pm and 8pm. That's because sleepiness tends to build up throughout the day. By early evening our body clock kicks in to wake us up. One reason may be to ensure we get home safely. When our ancestors were coming home after hunting all day their internal clocks kicked in to get them home in one piece.\"\nSo what effects do circadian rhythms have and what's the best time of day to take advantage of them?", "id": "high7129.txt"}
