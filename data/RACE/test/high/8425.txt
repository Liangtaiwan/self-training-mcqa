Only 4.75 percent of the young people surveyed said they like their parents.\nThe recently conducted survey among 3,000 middle school students in a Beijing district asked questions about their attitude toward their parents and family education, the paper said.\nFor many families, conflict between parents and children center on the student's school grades, their weight and their friends. The survey showed that parental influence over children is decreasing, the paper said.\nXiao Xiao, a third year junior middle school student is perhaps typical of most kids when she complains; \"I was scolded by my mother because I didn't come first in the class in a mid-term exam.\"\nXiao Xiao in fact is already one of the top students in her class, the paper said, stressing Xiao Xiao's parents hope she can study at the Beijing University or even attend Harvard in the future.\nSun Yunxiao, an expert with the China Youth and Children Research Center, said \"parents expect unrealistically high expectations from their children.\"\nThe research centre's own survey of parents showed about 55 percent of parents hope their children will study for a doctoral degree and 83.6 percent require their children to rank in the top 15 of their class.\nConflicts between parents and their children not only come from too high education expectations. Other causes of disconnection between parents and children are family violence, parents' old fashioned ideas, interference in a child's privacy including their choice of friends and time spent surfing the web, the paper said.\nMr Hu, a father of a middle school student, wasn't surprised by the survey results. He says too much concern over school marks is putting tremendous pressure on families.", "id": "high8425.txt"}
