Also at this time,sentences switched directions.A sentence read from leftto right.The next one read right to left,and then left to right again,etc.The ancient Romans sometimes punctuatedlike this:They put somethingthat can separate words in a sentence.The wordpunctuationactually comes from this idea andthe Latin word\"punctum\"which means a lot.\nWhen the 5th century arrived,there were just twopunctuation marks:spaces and points.The spaces separated words while the points showed pauses in reading.Then in the 13th century,a printer named Aldus Manutius tried to standardize punctuation.He always used a period for a complete stop at the end of a sentence.He used a slash(/)toindicate a short pause.Over time.that slash was shortened and curled,and it became the modern comma .\nSince that time,other marks have enlarged the punctuation family.The exclamation mark comes from the Latin word\"io\".It means \"exclamation of joy\".The question mark originally started out as the Latin word\"questio\",meaning\"question\".Eventually,scholars put it attheend of a sentence to show a question.\nPunctuation even keeps changing nowadays.New marks are coming into existence,and old punctuation marks are used in new ways.Take for example the\"interrobang\".This 1962 invention combines the question mark and exclamation mark for times when writers want both.For example.\"She did what?!\"or\"How much did you pay for that dress?!\"Obviously,the interrobang is not widelyused or recognized yet,but its invention shows that English is not yet finishedwith its punctuation.", "id": "high11591.txt"}
