This is because the glass glasses are more likely to do harm to children's eyesight.\nAlexander pointed out: wearing the right glasses as soon as possible is still the best way to cure and put right children's eyesight problems.\nIn America and Japan the resinous glasses have taken up 80 percent of the glasses market. And some European countries and America have made it a law that children, teenagers and drivers must wear resinous glasses. Now, about 10 million children in China have different eyesight problems and they need timely treatment.\nBut still, too many parents are buying the traditional glass glasses for their children. This is mainly because many parents know little or nothing about the good points of the resinous glasses. Besides, the price for the new glasses is a little higher than the traditional ones.", "id": "high7377.txt"}
