There are more countries where people seem to be living nearly _ each other because conditions are overcrowded . Then there are others where it seems that hardly anybody lives. What influences this unequal distribution of people ? There are specific advantages and disadvantages of living in a certain area.\nThe two main factors   that influence people's choice of location are climate and resources. Climate is the usual weather conditions in a region. Areas that have bad weather are generally less ideal as places to live in . The north and south poles at the top and bottom of the world may be beautiful in their rugged, natural way , but the disadvantage of the bitterly cold and windy conditions usually keeps people away. When it comes to climates, warm conditions and a normal amount of rainfall are advantages that attract people.\nNatural resources are tings that we get from nature that help us survive. Each region offers different resources, and therefore attracts different groups of people. People who enjoy the beach can make their living by catching and selling the ocean's many fish and other sea creature. Those who prefer farming can take advantage of rich soil in valleys near rivers. Some people are willing to accept the disadvantages of the terrible conditions of deserts or mountains in order to take advantages of the resources like oil or woods.", "id": "middle3259.txt"}
