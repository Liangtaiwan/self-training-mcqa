Ed earns his living with his feet! And a very good living it is, too.\nEd's story began in a very small town in Brazil. His father and mother were very poor. Seven people lived in their tiny house. Ed's father often played football. Little Ed wanted to play football too. So his father made a soft ball for him to kick. It was a sock filled with soft materials. The little boy kicked it every day.\nAt last Ed learned to kick a real football. By the time he was 11, he played football very well.\nOne day Ed was playing with some men. A man passing by saw how fast the boy ran. He stopped to watch. How well Ed kicked the ball!\nAfter the game, the man called Ed to him. \"My name is Mr. Dee,\" he said. \"I used to play football for a living. Will you let me teach you what I know?\"\n\"Oh, yes!\" Ed answered.\nIn the next four years, Mr. Dee trained Ed to be a fine player. The boy worked hard. At last Mr. Dee talked to Ed's father. \"This boy is ready to play with the big teams,\" he said. \"Let me take him to a city that has a good team.\"\nMr. Dee took Ed to Santos, Brazil. There, the boy joined the Santos Football Club.\nIn his first big game, Ed helped his team win by seven points. He made four of the seven points!\nMany people thought he was the best football player in the world. He was \"The King of Football\"", "id": "high8229.txt"}
