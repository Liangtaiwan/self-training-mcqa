It is her part to remain seated until you find her. Bow and say, \"I believe this is my dance.\"\nAt the end of a dance, thank your partner, but do not leave her until you have led her to a seat. Then, if you wish, you may excuse yourself, and go in search of your next partner.\nIf you cannot dance very well, it is always permissible to ask a lady if she is willing to _ a dance with you. Sometimes during the evening, your hostess, the daughter of the hostess, and any guest of honor should all be asked by you to dance.", "id": "high8032.txt"}
