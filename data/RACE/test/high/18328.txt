Most said they were making do with less or going without some favorite items.\n\"The habits learned during this economic crisis have the potential to permanently change the mind-set of consumers,\" the report said. \"The vast majority of shoppers who are changing their near-term shopping behavior say they plan to continue them as the economy improves.\"\nTo ease the consumer discomfort, smart retailers will focus on downsizing, the report said, as adding stores to an already crowded retail landscape is out of fashion.
