They tried to live simple lives so that they could have time for what was most important.\nThey didn't busy themselves buying a bigger house, because that would mean working harder to pay the monthly mortgage ,working overtime or taking second job. Who would go running with me then? Who would read stories to me?\nThey didn't burden themselves with buying an expensive car because that would mean worrying about installment  bills. Besides, walking to the shopping centre every Saturday afternoon with me gave my dad his needed exercise, and made me feel so special.\nOne of my heart's delights was seeing Dad and Mom in their bedroom at night, after our nightly family prayer.
