Sometimes attempts at emergency treatment turn out to be more dangerous than the bite itself, with amateurs heroically, but mistakenly, trying do-it-yourself surgery and other unnecessary measures.\nAll snakes have small teeth, so it follows tha tall snakes can bite, but only te bite of the adder presents any danger.
