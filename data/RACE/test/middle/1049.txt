There are many places of interest in Beijing, such as the Summer Palace, the Great Wall, etc. What's more, I think great changes have taken place in Beijing. People's living conditions have improved a lot. Their life is very happy. Almost everyone has a big smile on the face. People in Beijing are in high spirits and hard-working. Children can receive a good education.\nBut in the past, some children didn't have enough money to go to school. They often worked for cruel bosses. The bosses didn't give them enough food. I feel sorry for them. Today people have already lived in tall building, worn beautiful clothes and so on. Life has changed greatly.", "id": "middle1049.txt"}
