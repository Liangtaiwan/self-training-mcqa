Its wingspan seemed to be at least three times my height, which would have made it at least fourteen feet across.\nWhile the early childhood memory is often unreliable, I clearly remember the details of the  \"Thunderbird\".To this very day, I sometimes stand on my grandmother' s yard, eyeballing the old oak tree, but I have not yet seen another bird that resembles the giant bird.I have seen eagles, and hawks - but never another Thunderbird.\nOther modern sightings of what may have been thunderbirds have also occurred.In 1977, three boys were playing in a neighborhood in Illinois.They reported that two large birds chased after  them.One of the boys was attacked and suffered somewhat serious injuries, He was carried a few  feet off the ground, before the bird dropped him and disappeared into the wilderness.\nSeveral people interviewed the boys and their story remained the same, even under the pressure.the description of the birds somewhat matched the Andean condor ; however, these  massive condors have never been known to exist in the United States.\nAnother sighting came in 2002, in Alaska, when many people reported seeing a bird with a fourteen - foot wingspan.After being investigated, it was finally concluded that the bird was most likely a particularly large sea eagle, which typically has a wingspan of six to eight fickle.\nI will probably never know what the strange -looking giant bird from the oak tree was, and biologists will probably never be able to fully confirm the identity of the giant raptors spotted in Illinois and Alaska.If the Thunderbird does indeed exist, it will probably continue to remain mysterious.", "id": "high18655.txt"}
