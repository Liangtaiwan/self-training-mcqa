These are some of the most popular brands   around. They are also expensive. But some experts say they are not much better than cheaper brands.\nFor example, Jim Wilcox works for Consumer Reports. He tested all kinds of headphones. He says that $80 Koss Pro headphones provide basically the same quality   and comfort as Beats. So why do people pay twice or even 10 times as much for the hottest brands?\nExperts say it's because fashionable, expensive brands send a message. Brands say \"I belong\" or \"I can afford it.\"\nSome people think that expensive brand names are worth the price. They say that some designer clothes really are top quality and that they last longer than cheaper brands. Some teenagers choose to wear popular brands because these brands make them feel good about themselves.\nAlexandra Allam, 17, likes to buy brand-name products. \"I'd rather spend the extra money to get something I know I'll be satisfied with,\" she says. Her friend Emmy Swan agrees, saying \"As long as you can afford it, it seems reasonable to buy what you want.\" But not all teenagers agree. \"Spending hundreds of dollars for designer sunglasses is stupid and unreasonable,\" says Daniel Steinbrecher, 16. \"It's fake   happiness.\"\nPeople who are against wearing expensive brand names say that many designer brands aren't any better. \"It's wasteful to buy things just because they are popular,\" says Edmund Williams, 15. \"You'll feel better if you buy things because you like them. If you have extra money to spend, it would be better to give it to people in need.\"", "id": "high19158.txt"}
