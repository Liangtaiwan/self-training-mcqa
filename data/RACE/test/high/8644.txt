The result was inspiring.They confirmed their locations and measured the sizes of their Village,houses and gardens.\"We can find isolated vinages with remote sensing and study them over time.\"Walker told Live Science.\"We can ask:Are they growing?Do they move?\"\nSurprisingly,based on the sizes of the houses and Villages,the scientists find the population densities of these isolated villages are about 10 times greater,on average,than other villages of native Brazilian peoples.This may be due to the fact that they have to live closer together because they are not as good at clearing the forest,since they lack modern devices like chainsaws and tractors,the researchers said.The tribes may also be afraid of spreading out due to fear of being attacked by outsiders,Walker said.\nThe researchers now plan to focus on 29 more isolated villages to\"look at their ecology--that is.distance from rivers and roads--and use this to model where else we can find more isolated villages,\"Walker said.", "id": "high8644.txt"}
