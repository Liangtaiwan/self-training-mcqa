You may believe that every other type of pollution has a larger impact on the environment than light pollution does. But light pollution is serious.\nLight pollution, or \"sky glow\", is the glow  you can see at night above cities and towns. Light pollution is a problem that has been accompanying man ever since he started his first fire some 15,000 years ago. Light pollution is the light  that comes from streetlights, buildings, parking lots and any other source of light that is reflected or directed into the atmosphere.\nUrban light pollution means that one-fifth of the world's population can no longer see the Milky Way  with the naked eye . Many city kids, even if they did look through the orange smog above their heads, would probably see only a handful of stars. We have lost our view of the stars, and we have _ our  night-time environment as well. Astronomers are calling for the dark places on Earth to be preserved as national parks.\nLots of people find the ever-brightening night annoying, and animals that are programmed to prefer the dark may avoid a brightened habitat. Sea turtles can get lost searching for a beach to lay eggs, and their hatchlings may confuse over-lit beachfront resorts  for the ocean horizon, wasting precious energy needed to find the sea and escape predators . Because their necks aren't yet long enough to see things far away, baby turtles rely on the mirror image of the moon to guide them to the sea, to begin their new life. A car may even hit a particular turtle, which was thinking the light from a nearby city was moonlight reflecting off the ocean waves. Birds that live in and around cities can die because of sky glow, too. The bright lights can blind them, leading to countless collisions with buildings and other tall structures.\nReducing light pollution is not difficult.Light pollution is the easiest type of pollution to end. people can help reduce much sky glow by using lighting only when necessary. The stars above us are priceless heritage-- for not only for astronomers but for all humans. More of our children should be able to look up at night and see the Milk Way is not just a candy bar.", "id": "high7910.txt"}
