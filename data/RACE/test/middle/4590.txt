He is going to meet Miss Fox. She bought a bag of diamonds from Africa. A few hours ago, someone told the police that a group of thieves would try to steal the diamonds, so the police asked Detective Wolf to make sure Miss Fox and her diamonds would be safe.\nMiss Fox arrived in the airport. Detective Wolf quickly helped her get into the police car and took her to the hotel. While they were talking, Detective Wolf noticed that Miss Fox was left-handed. Half and hour later, they got to the room, two policemen checked it over and made sure there wasn't anyone else in it. Miss Fox said she was tired and wanted to have a shower. She asked Detective Wolf and the policemen to keep the diamonds for her. Half an hour later, Miss Fox didn't get out. Detective Wolf felt a little strange. Just then he got a call from the airport-a woman was found in the toilet on the plane. She said she was Miss Fox and reported the criminal was left-handed. Detective Wolf rushed to the bathroom but saw nobody in it. He opened the bag immediately and found there were only stones in it.(<<>> )", "id": "middle4590.txt"}
