Authoritative parents are demanding and controlling while also being warm and sensitive to their children's needs.\nAuthoritarian parents, on the contrary, are demanding and controlling without the appearance of caring, attachment and receptiveness. They take a \"my way or the highway\" approach to their kids.\nPermissive parents, the third group, have warm and receptive qualities, but they set few boundaries and carry out few rules.\nUsing data on early 600 kids from an ongoing study of middle school and high school students in New Hampshire, researchers from the University of New Hampshire were able to find \"my way or the highway\" parenting with more violent behaviors like robbery, drug-taking, and attacking someone else with the intention of hurting or killing.\nFirm but loving parenting, on the other hand, led to fewer lawbreakers. Permissive parenting, surprisingly, didn't seem to make much of a difference either.\nTo explain the link between parenting style and behavior in kids, the researchers suggested that what matters most is how reasonable kids think their parents' power is. This sense comes when kids trust that their parents are making the best decisions for them and believe that they need to do what their parents say even if they don't always like how their parents are treating them.\nWhen kids respect the power of their parents, the researchers reported in the journal of Adolescence, their behavior is better. Previous research has also linked firm but caring parenting with kids who have more self-control and independence.\n\"When children consider their parents to be the reliable figure, they trust the parents and feel that they have a duty to do what their parents tell them to do,\" said lead researcher Pick Trinkner. \"This is very important as the parent doesn't have to rely on a system of rewards and punishments to control behavior and the child is more likely to follow the rules when the parent is not physically present.\"", "id": "high11706.txt"}
