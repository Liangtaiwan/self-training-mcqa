And there's a goodchance that you've also expressed the phrase, \"I never meant to hurt you.\"\nStop doing that, says author Caroline Myss.\nIn a talk Myss - a spiritual researcher - took on the topic of forgiveness and healing, and explained in no uncertain terms why \"I never meant to hurt you\" is never a sufficient apology, no matter who it comes from.\n\"Picture that person coming up to you and saying, 'Wow, l'm sorry I did this, but, you know ,l never meant to hurt you. And, hey, can we just call it a day?\"' Myss says.\nThough it can make the two bur\\ the hatchet and keep friendship, that type of apology won't sit well with the person on the receiving end. \"That whole little thing -  'I never meant to hurt you' - that's the thing you can't forgive,\" she says. \"It goes right to your soul, that toxic  (, )  , sick feeling.\"\nInstead, Myss says it's important to approach the conversation differently. Basically, it's about offering more than an apology. It's about sharing a soul-to-soul confession    . \"Let's redo the scene,\" Myss says. \"The person comes up to you and says... 'I need to tell you something. Iconsciously knew what I was doing. I know I went against you. This is not an apology. 1 amconfessing my soul to you, and l'm asking now for your forgiveness.\"'\nEven saying those words on stages makes Myss visibly emotional, and she points out that this is how deeply apologies within the soul are supposed to resonate     .\n\"That's what heals,\" she says.", "id": "high19769.txt"}
