We've been going to the same spot in the Pacific Ocean, and we try and characterize long-term change in the open ocean environment. And one of the key things that we measure is CO2levels. And we've been able to record this increasing quantity of atmospheric CO2into the ocean.\nScientists expected that as atmospheric CO2increased, more and more of the carbon dioxide would be absorbed into the ocean, affecting the chemical balance of the sea water, with a potentially harmful impact on shellfish and coral in particular.\n\"As carbon dioxide dissolves  in the water, or seawater in this case, it forms a weak acid, carbonic acid,\" Dore explains. \"And therefore, as the concentration of CO2in the atmosphere goes up and that exchanges with the surface seawater, it drives the PH down, and makes it more acidic.\"\nThe seawater Dore and his colleagues have analyzed confirms what the theory predicts.\nThe effect was particular striking at about 250 meters down, and again at 500 meters. Dore and his colleagues came up with two possible explanations. It could be that surface water picked up CO2and then moved to those depths. Or there could be a biological explanation.\n\"It's important to realize that the oceans are really becoming acidic. And it can have negative  impacts on a whole variety of sea life from fish to coral. It's potentially catastrophic.\"", "id": "high1634.txt"}
