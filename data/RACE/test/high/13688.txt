That is because its visual processing abilities and fingers work together faster than any human brain. A video of the undefeated robot has been watched by more than 3 million viewers on YouTube since going online at the end of June.\nTokyo University engineering professor Masatoshi Ishikawa has a good-natured response to frustrated human losers who accuse him of essentially creating a robot that cheats. \"It is not cheating. Every one millisecond the image processor decides and recognizes the shape the human hand is going to make. And then the robot can make a winnable shape one millisecond later than a human being. Only one millisecond, but a human cannot see this difference because the human eye is very slow,\" explained Ishikawa.\nAt the Ishikawa Oku Laboratory there has been amazing progress which shows the near perfect accuracy of robotics. Such as a robot that can catch a falling egg without breaking it, another one that can tie a knot, and a robot that may not be quite ready for the NBA, but is able to dribble  a ball.\nIn sports such as baseball and cricket, the misses outnumber(......)successes for even the most skilled athletes. That is not so in this award-winning school laboratory. For instance, an intelligent robot is the result of five years of research and a lot of trial and error. And the cost of just one finger on the robot is equal to that of a mini car.\nThe technology obviously has uses beyond fun and games. Corporations are eager to take advantage of the lab's technology for industrial and other practical uses. And there is talk of applying it to assist disabled people and improve human capabilities.", "id": "high13688.txt"}
