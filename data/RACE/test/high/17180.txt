For example, they can be used as a sensing equipment to look for explosives or drugs or to help determine how old an art work is through its powders.\n      They can cost as much as $100,000, but Masterman's invention--made of lenses, a laser, aluminum tubing and a camera--cost less than $1,000, Intel said.\n      Masterman received the honor from Intel Corp. Chairman Craig Barrett during a banquet Tuesday night inWashington.\n      \"It was a complete surprise,\" Masterman said. \"I wasn't expecting it.\"\n      Masterman said she has been interested in science ever since she was little. She couldn't remember ever not being interested. _ \n      She said she has not decided where she will attend college but would eventually like to become a physicist or chemist.\n      Among the former winners of the competitions top award are six Nobel Laureates , three National Medal of Science winners, 10 MacArthur Foundation Fellows and two Fields Medalists.\n      \"You're not only dealing with the top young person in the science field in the country in Mary, but you're dealing with 40 finalists who are doing breaking--edge research in total,\" said Brenda Musilli, Intel's director of education. \"It's really something that's hard to imagine, how a young person like Mary could even achieve this level of capability at such a young age.\"", "id": "high17180.txt"}
