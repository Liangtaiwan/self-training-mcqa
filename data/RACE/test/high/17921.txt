Her younger son, Alex, then six years old, was getting good grades in his private kindergarten classes. But Lee realized something was wrong when Alex came home one day, crying, with \"zeroes\" on his Chinese spelling test. Lee decided to investigate. According to Lee, the teacher would frequently describe Alex's Chinese writing as 'ghost writings' and made him a laughing stock in class instead of helping him out.\nLee, 46, spent the next 12 months teaching Alex and still helps him when necessary. She not only taught him the formation of the Chinese words but also their origin so that he could understand better, often taking more than an hour to read a simple paragraph. Visits to the library and surfing the Internet kept her up to speed on teaching materials. Alex's grades improved and by the end of Year One, he had become one of the top students in Chinese in his class.\nAlex is keeping an A - plus average in all subjects, and his mother's involvement is a big reason behind it. Alex, now 11, recently wrote a book recording his struggles with Chinese, which an international education center has published to inspire its students. He sometimes writes for local student magazines as well. \nLee has always had input into the education of Alex. She reads to him \"all the time.\" As a result, he is an eager reader who regularly visit the library.\nTo Lee, one of the most valuable things she does is to take turns with her husband to drive Alex to school. \"We'd talk along the way. Talking enables me to have a better understanding of my child and reminds me of changes every now and then so that I know when to get involved, she says.\"", "id": "high17921.txt"}
