For more than 30 years, they had been getting along very well.\nThen their good relationship broke. It began with a small thing, then bitter words, and then weeks of silence. One morning Farmer John woke up to find a stream between the two farms. \"It must be Bob,\" John thought.\nThen one day there was a knock on John's door. He opened it to find a carpenter  standing at the doorway.\n\"I'm looking for a few days' work,\" the carpenter said.\n\"I do have a job for you,\" John said. \"Look across the stream at that farm. That's my neighbor Bob. He dug a stream between the two farms. I want you to build a fence--an 8-foot fence. I don't want to see his place or his face any more. I don't have such a neighbor!\"\nThe carpenter said, \"I think I know what to do, sir, and I'll be able to do a job that pleases you.\"\nFarmer John helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was off for the day.\nAbout sunset when the farmer returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. The farmer's eyes opened wide. There was no fence there at all!\nIt was a bridge! And the neighbor, Bob, was coming across, with his hand outstretched . \"Hi, John! _ \nThen they met in the middle, taking each other's hands. \"I'm terribly sorry for what I have said and done. We should be good to each other,\" said Farmer Bob.\nThen they turned to see the carpenter, who was ready to go. \"No, wait! Stay a few days. I have a lot of other jobs for you,\" said Farmer John. \"I'd love to stay,\" the carpenter said, \"but I have more bridges to build.\"", "id": "high5471.txt"}
