People can work on a farm. They can also grow, water, sell and steal vegetables, flowers, fruits and so on. They can earn some e-money from their working on the farm. Then they can use it to buy more seeds, pets and even houses. Of course, all these are not true, they are only on the Internet.\nWhy do so many young people enjoy the kind of Farm game? I think maybe some of them are afraid of facing the real world, and they have to look for fun from the Internet. Some feel lonely and want to make friends during growing vegetables on the Internet. Some have great fun _ others' vegetables because they needn't work on their farm.\nMost parents and teachers are worried about these young people and students. Students spend too much time playing the game. It's bad for their health and study.", "id": "middle4757.txt"}
