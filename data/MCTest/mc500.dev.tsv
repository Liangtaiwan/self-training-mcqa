As he was enjoying the sun and the newspaper, he saw a bug crawl across his blanket. At first Stewart thought it was an ant, but the bug was moving too slowly to be an ant. As Stewart leaned in for a closer look, the bug cried out, "Excuse me, sir! Can you help me?" Stewart was surprised and jumped to his feet. "You can talk!" he shouted. "Yes," said the bug. "Please help me! As you might know, there is a rainstorm coming into town. Unfortunately, I do not have a place to call home. I need to find somewhere to sleep before the rain washes me away!" Stewart felt sad. "Gee," he cried. "That sounds terrible!"\newline\newlineStewart thought about the problem. "Perhaps you can stay at my house," he said. The bug jumped for joy and said, "Oh, that would be wonderful!" The two traveled back to Stewart's house and the bug found a soft spot to sleep.\newline\newlineThe next day, the sky had darkened and rain clouds appeared all over town. Just as the news had said, a rainstorm had arrived. When Stewart woke up, he looked for the bug but could not find him. Then, he saw something flying around his house. "Thank you for letting me sleep here last night," said the butterfly. It was the bug! "I knew I could not change into a butterfly if I was out in the rain. I won't forget your kindness."

She had a beautiful voice and everyone who heard it said she was the best singer in the land. But her uncle believed singing would keep her from her job as princess, so he found a witch and paid her to steal Princess Ellen's voice. The witch made a spell which gave Ellen the witch's voice. The spell also gave Ellen's voice to the witch. The witch went on to become famous as a singer, and Ellen grew up to be Queen. One day Queen Ellen heard of a singer who was the best in the land. She went to hear this singer, and was surprised to hear her own voice coming from the woman on stage. When the show was over, Ellen found the singer and gave her a penny.

Although the pink moon could see all the lizards and cacti in the empty sand land, nobody could see the moon! The pink moon felt so lonely. So, the pink moon called on the sun for help. The great sun was very busy high in the sky, for it was his job to shine over the sand land, and it was hard to get his attention. So the moon wiggled closer and closer to the sun every second. The second turned to hours as the pink moon inched toward his friend, slowly moving across the sky. Finally, the sun saw the moon and asked, "Pink moon! What are you doing here? Don't you know the sky is my home during the day? Your time is coming soon enough. Look, I'm falling now toward my bed on the end of the earth..." But the pink moon could not be stopped and kept moving toward the great sun. "But great sun, I become so lonely during the day when your light is so bright the animals in the sand land can't see me. Please let me join your light during the day this once!" By this time, the great sun and pink moon were only inches apart. The great sun said, "Though by day you disappear, I always remember you are here. Come to me now. Stand in front of me, and show the sand land your shine!" So the pink moon inched in front of the great sun. At first, covering part of the sun's circle, then more, then...a complete covering of the sun! The pink moon was shining with the power and light of the sun! All the lizards, cacti and every animal stood still in awe of the daytime pink moon! But at that time, the sun slipped away, saying "Farewell, pink moon. We have to do this again!"

His mother asked "Why not?" but his father was silent. Tim knew his father didn't believe he could be a racer: only last year, he had sent Tim to a doctor to ask why his son wasn't a better runner. The doctor told him Tim could be anything he wanted to be, and maybe he didn't like to run. \newline\newlineTim, who had always preferred a good book to P.E. class, wanted to show his family that he really could be what they wanted him to be, so he spent his allowance on a pair of green running shoes and signed up for his school's Spring Fun Run. \newline\newlineTim answered, "I'm going to try to win, but Angela is so quick! No one ever beats her at recess." \newline\newline"Well, we'll be there for you, either way" his mother said.\newline\newlineTim took an apple and walked to the bus. Since the race was after school today (school was letting out at 3:00 today, instead of 3:15), he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began. He didn't even bring his new book with him, an action book starring an orphan named Simon that Tim sometimes pretended to be.\newline\newline3:30 arrived and the race was about to begin. All the other students had brought running shorts, but Tim was going to have to run in his school pants. Suddenly, he saw that his shoes were untied. As he bent down to tie them, one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee, making him fall down right as the race began. By the time he got up and tied his shoes, he saw he would finish in last place, as the other kids were much farther ahead of him. \newline\newlineIt was almost 4:00 before Tim saw the end of the run. By the time Tim reached the finish line, the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small, as some kids had been finished for a long time. Tim's father asked, "What took you so long? I'm surprised to see you here at all! Why did you sign up for this when we all knew you wouldn't win?" \newline\newlineTim thought about why he signed up. It wasn't about winning the race, or making his father proud.

When Bill and Sarah arrived at the park, they first played ball in the grass near the playground. Then they chose to pretend that Bill was a monster and Sarah was the monster hunter. Sarah chased Bill all over the playground. They went in and out and up and down. Bill ran under the slide and stepped in a puddle. He didn't get hurt but he sure got plenty wet. Playing the monster game was the most fun that they had at the park that day. Later they sat in the grass for a picnic. They both took off their shoes so that Bill's feet could dry off and so that he wouldn't feel silly without shoes. Sarah took out her lunch and laid it out next to her. She had dried fruit and cheese and a peanut butter sandwich. Bill opened his lunch bag and found a coke, a bag of chips, and a ham salad sandwich. Sarah wanted to trade Bill his bag of chips for her fruit. He said that would be a fair trade and they enjoyed their lunch together.

One Saturday afternoon, she sits at the kitchen table. She draws a picture of her family. She makes sure to draw her mom named Martha wearing a purple dress, because that is her favorite. She draws many yellow feathers for her pet bird named Andy. After she is done, she gives the picture to her mom. Her mom hangs it up on the silver refrigerator. The next day, Lucy's mom comes home with a brown dog named Oliver. She tells Lucy that she is pet-sitting, which is like babysitting but with a friend's dog. Lucy's mom tells her she can play with the dog as long as she takes good care of him. Lucy is excited. She pets Oliver nicely on his soft back. He wags his tail. He barks, "Woof!" and shows he wants to play fetch with her. Lucy giggles and throws a ball for him to catch.
