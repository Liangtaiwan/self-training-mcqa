She had planned what to do after graduation in the UK: two years' work experience at a restaurant and a tour around Europe. But now her plans are up in the air.\n         Following the UK Home Secretary's meeting on reform of the student immigration system, the UK government recently announced the end of the post-study work visa from April 2012. This will force tens of thousands of Chinese students to leave the UK after graduation.\n         Sadly, the domestic job market doesn't welcome them with open arms. A report by Tigtag.com at the end of 2011 showed that over 35 percent of students admitted that they have employment problems.\n         \"Returning students often have fluent English, creative minds and a serious attitude toward work,\" said Zhang Tingwen, an HR expert in ChinaHR.com. \"But lack of work experience is a big problem.\" Xia Lei, an HR manager, responded to Zhang. \"We need people who can work for us. We don't need people from big name universities to attract customers\".\n         Difference in work practices is another problem that worries employers, Zhang pointed out. \"Some returning students might be used to Western ways of dealing with people and things.\"\n         Huang Shanshan, 25, got a job in a communication company in Shenzhen.   \"I once worked part-time in UK. My colleagues ate snacks when they felt hungry, even during working time or in meetings.\" Huang brought some cakes to the office and ate them. When her manager saw that, he told her not to eat at workplace. \"It took me some time to adjust to company rules in China,\" said Huang.", "id": "high21265.txt"}
