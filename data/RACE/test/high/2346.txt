He and his five-year-old son were decorating the Christmas tree, and a little boy came to the front door begging. If you ever visit Mexico, you will see that the people there take begging as nothing to get upset about and nothing to get embarrassed by.\nSo, this little boy came to the door, a boy about the same age as my student's son. The father and the son went to the front door, and the father went back with his five-year-old son and said to him, \"Give him one of your toys.\" At the words, the little boy quickly picked up some toy, and his father said to him, \"No, no-give him your favorite toy.\"\nAnd the little boy, like a little tiger, said, \"No way!\" He cried; he refused. But the father, like a big tiger in a way, insisted gently, \"No, you must give him one of your favorite toys.\"\nAnd finally the boy, with his head down, picked up a toy he had just gotten. The father waited in the living room, and the boy walked to the front door with the toy in his hand. The father waited and waited.\nWhat do you think happened?\nAfter a couple of minutes, his son came running back into the living room, his face radiant  . \"Daddy,\" he said, \"can I do that again?\"\nI think I have got the answer to the question.", "id": "high2346.txt"}
