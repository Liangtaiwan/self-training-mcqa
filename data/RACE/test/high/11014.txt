His job is to share his expertise  with students in schools, chess camps and other events.\nDuring Sudan's civil war in the mid-1980s, Juac was forced out of the country with 20,000 0ther so -called Lost Boys. He fled to Ethiopia, then to Kenya staying in a refugee camp for eight years, where he learned to play chess.\nJuac described a dangerous journey in which half the boys didn't survive. To eat, they had to kill wild animals.\n\"There were animals on the way. It was about a thousand miles and sometimes there was no water. When we were in Ethiopia, we had to cross the river and there a lot drowned.\"\nJuac arrived in the United States in 2004 and began working as a security guard. Winning a chess tournament gave him this teaching opportunity. Juac believes chess helps prepare young people for life.\n\"Some kids are not interested, so it's your job to make them like the game, to explain them what chess is going to help them with.\" He said. \"Like, I can tell, this game will give you patience, and help with your math skills.\"\nJulie Cathone, a second grade teacher in Jackson Public School, agrees. The School's principal, Meghan Kelley, said Juac and chess have made a big difference.\n\"What a role model. I mean when you think about just overcoming, and finding what you love and turning that into your life's work.\"\nJuac said he enjoys the freedom he has in the United States. But his passion is playing and teaching chess to youngsters. His boss, Michael Propper , said Juac has one great advantage.\n\"I think he's believable. I think they look at him and he's so _ that they feel like they can do what he's doing and be a person as he is too.\"\nJu ac still has a big goal ahead of him-becoming an international chess master. With his skill and patience, Propper and his peers have no doubt that will happen.", "id": "high11014.txt"}
