It is important to know the ways you can use and show them to everyone else in the family, such as stairways and emergency exits, but not elevators.\nFrom the lower floors of building, escape through windows is possible. Learn the best way to get out from a window with the least chance of serious injury.\nThe second floor window is usually not very high from the ground. An average person, hanging by the fingertips will have a drop of about 6 feet to the ground. It is about twice the height of an average man. Of course, it is safer to jump a short way down than to stay in a burning building.\nWindows are also useful when you are waiting for help. Be sure to keep the door closed before opening the window. Otherwise, smoke and fire may be drawn into the room. Keep your head low at the window to be sure you get fresh air rather than smoke that may have leaked into the room.\nOn the second or third floor, the best windows for escape are those which open onto a roof. From the roof a person can drop to the ground more safely. Dropping onto cement might end in injury. Bushes and trees can help you to have a soft landing.", "id": "high10892.txt"}
