You love them or you think you love them. And you hope that they love you. But do you ever really understand them?\n    Charlie Kemp and his family lived next door to me for 15 years. We were good friends all the time. I enjoy friendship. I think it's the best thing in the world. And friendship with the Kemps was easy because they seemed to welcome it.\n    They were interesting and clever people. Their house caught fire twice, and twice the whole family slept in mine. They are always losing things like money, keys and watches. Pictures fell off the walls, the children fell out of bed ...\n    I was their neighbor and their friend. Life was always interesting, never dull. Best of all, I liked the whole family.\n    One day, I lit a fire in the garden to burn some rubbish. After some time Charlie Kemp came out of his house and walked up the road.\n    \"Morning, Charlie,\" I said, \"lovely day, isn't it?\" He smiled at me and nodded. I went on with my work.\nTwenty minutes later, a policeman arrived. He walked into my garden and said, \"You'll have to put out that fire. Your neighbor has complained   to us. He doesn't like the smell.\"\n\"My neighbor ...?\" I asked.\n    \"Yes,\" the policeman took out his notebook and read, \"Charlie Kemp. He lives next door, doesn't he?\"", "id": "high17966.txt"}
