It's different for everyone, but the pain is often sharp  . If the break is small, however, the person may not feel much pain at all. If you think that you or someone else has broken a bone, the most important things to do are to stay calm, make the hurt person comfortable, and call the doctor. Do not move the injured body part since movement could make it worse.\nTo treat the break, the doctor will need to take an X-ray. This gives the doctor the information he or she needs to set   the bone: to put it back to its normal place. If the bone is large or it is broken in more than one place, the doctor may need to use metal pins   to set it. After the bone has been set, the next step is usually putting on a cast, the special, hard thing that will keep the bone in place for a month or two.\nYour bones are excellent at healing themselves. Broken bones will produce many new cells   and tiny blood vessels  . These cover both ends of the broken part, and close up the break until the bone is as whole and strong as before.", "id": "middle251.txt"}
