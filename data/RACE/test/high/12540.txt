William Burk, a pet food specialist from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), believes that feeding raw meat to pets is against its goal of protecting the public from health dangers, and that raw meat and bones do not have all the required nutrition that a pet needs every day.\nRecognizing how popular these foods are, the FDA has provided guidelines for producers of pet foods which contain uncooked meat for dogs, cats and other pets. The guidelines give rules to protect pet owners and pets from dangers about food safety and lack of nutrition.\nPet owners who feed raw meat and bones to their pets should deal with these products very carefully to protect themselves against possible dangers, says Burk.  Just as when you are preparing foods for human beings, use hot water and soap to wash your hands, containers, and surfaces that come into contact with the food. Don't put your hands near your mouth until you have washed them, and don't allow your pet to touch your face right after it has eaten raw meat.\n\"If pet owners choose to feed bones to their pets, they should watch their pets carefully when they are eating bones,\" Burk says. \"If a pet eats a big piece of bone that won't pass through its digestive system , it is likely to kill the pet.\"", "id": "high12540.txt"}
