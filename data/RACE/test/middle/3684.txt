She had come to play half an hour ago, and I didn't want her to go. \"Your mother said you could stay an hour.\" I said.\nAnn pointed at the Teddy Bear on my desk. \"I'll stay if you give me your Teddy Bear.\" she said.\nI couldn't imagine giving it to her. It was a special gift from Aunt Reba on my tenth birthday. My aunt was a beautiful and kind woman who was never too busy to spend time with me. The day she died, I cried for hours, unable to believe that I would never see her again. Now, when I saw the Teddy Bear, I was filled with memories  of Aunt Reba.\n\"Come on,\" Ann shouted, \"I'm your best friend.\"\nI don't know what came over me, but I really wanted someone to play with me. So I handed Ann the Teddy Bear! Then, she stayed.\nThat evening I went to bed without dinner. The memories of Aunt Reba brought tears to my eyes. How _ I felt. I was sad all night.\nAlone in the dark, I asked myself, \"Is Ann really my best friend?\"\nAt school the next day, I found Ann. I asked for the Teddy Bear. She was surprised at first. Then she thought for a few seconds and finally said, \"Okay, I don't like it anyway.\"\nAfter that, Ann and I stopped playing together. Through the years, I have had other best friends. I have come to understand that best friends are people who want to spend time with you, and they ask nothing in return.", "id": "middle3684.txt"}
