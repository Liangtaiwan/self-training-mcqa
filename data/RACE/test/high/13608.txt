What if you could use all of those rotten vegetables to heat your home? That's happening in one unlikely laboratory: the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plan in Brooklyn\nThe plant's longtime manager, Jimmy Pynn, shows off the plant's crown jewels: eight huge, shiny, oval-shaped steel tanks known as digester eggs. Each one contains millions of gallons of black material that's roughly pea soup. Pynn calls it \"black gold\". \"The digesters like to be fed like us: three times a day,\" he says. \"They like to be kept warm, 98 degrees. And that's what we have these guys for: to make methane ,which can be used to heat homes or make electricity.\"\nRight now, what these bacteria are digesting is mostly sewage  mud. But they are being introduced to a new diet food scraps. The hope is that this plant will soon take in hundreds of tons of organic waste from houses and apartments.\n\"Cardboard packaging, rotten tomatoes, fats, oils, old diary products--those are all great food-stuff for a digester,\" says Paul Sellew. \"My micro-organisms love that. That's their five-course meal.\"\n\"Everything in New York City is like big scale when you're talking about quantities of waste,\" says Samantha MacBride. \"Right now, it's all in its infancy. When you're in an apartment building, to separate out food scraps, it requires a lot of effort and attention,\" says MacBride. \"It doesn't have to have unpleasant smell or be inconvenient. But it takes extra work. It's the first, what I will call the baby step,\" says Paul Sellew. \"Because ultimately in New York City, just the restaurants alone, you're talking well over a million tons a year,\" he says.\nThis new industry is trying to build more plants and digesters to handle all of that waste, says Sellew. The costliest part may be finding good locations in or around the nation's biggest cities.\nAs for the trillions of bacteria? They'll work for free--- as long as you feed them.", "id": "high13608.txt"}
