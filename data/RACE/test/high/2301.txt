They never write, unless homework requires it. They find the writing process painful and difficult.\nHow awful it is to be able to speak in a language but not to write in it, especially with its rich vocabulary. Being able to speak but not write is like living in _ and never leaving one small room. When I meet students who think they can't write, I know, as a teacher my duty is to show them the rest of the rooms. My task is to build fluency and accuracy while providing the opportunity in any writing activity to enhance the moral and emotional development of my students.\nOne great way to do this is by having students write in a journal in class every day.\nWriting ability is like strength training. Writing needs to be done just like exercise; just as muscles grow stronger with exercise, writing skills improve quickly with writing practice daily. I often see a rise in student confidence and performance after only a few weeks of journal writing.\nExpressing oneself in writing is one of the most important skills I teach to strengthen the whole students. When my students practice journal writing, they are practicing for their future academic, political, and emotional lives. They build skills so that some say they might write a great novel, a piece of sorely needed legislation , or the perfect love letter. That they write in their journals every day puts them a step closer to fluency, eloquence and command of the language.", "id": "high2301.txt"}
