Citizens of New Castle simply refer to it as \"The Miracle\".\nJoel Haler woke up in his dorm room at Hope College last October totally paralyzed from the waist down. Four hospitals later, the only way he could walk was through Robotic Walking Treatment.\n\"This past Tuesday, I was doing the Robotic walk and lasted ten minutes,\" Joel said. After that, he gave up. Joel wanted to accept the inevitable  and cancelled his next Robotic Walking Treatment appointment.\nThen, the night before his cancelled appointment, he woke up to a terrible pain. An hour and a half later, the serious pain left him with an unusual feeling in his legs.\n\"As it continued to move up my legs, it became more and more painful and it took an hour and a half to reach my hips ,\" Joel recalled.\n\"I stood up and walked into my parents' room. 'Mom and dad, look!',\" he said proudly.\n\"He said something and I was like, 'Joel! Joel! You're walking! You're walking!' We jumped out of bed, cried and hugged,\" Joel's mom Karen remembered.\n\"I burst into tears. It's hard seeing your son not be able to walk, but he was standing there, walking,\" Joel's father Eric said, tearfully.\nIt was Thursday, January 23, when he could finally walk. That date made perfect sense to Joel. He had dreamt of a calendar that only said \"J 23\". He didn't know what to make of it until \"a little boy at church, four years old, came up to me and said, 'you will walk on a Thursday',\" Joel recalled.\nSo the 20-year-old college student, who could only walk with the aid of robot on Tuesday, was walking on his own.", "id": "high18469.txt"}
