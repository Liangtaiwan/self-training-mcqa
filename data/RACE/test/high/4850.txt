We explore our dreams and develop personal dreams. We even like to dream BIG!\nFor the most part our dreams and wishes focus on the end result. We see ourselves in love, married, driving a great car, on vacation, with tons of money, in a great career, etc. Dreaming about the end result is just fantasizing and wishing. Wishing relies on some magical force to make our dreams turn into reality, and we become unhappy as we're not living  our dreams.\nSo how can we make our dreams come true? That is a question we all often struggle with. Even though we struggle with the answer, the answer is not that clear. We make our dreams come true with the action we take.\nIn my opinion, if you dream about being in good health, then change your dream to see yourself working out and eating right day by day. See the beginning of the dream and let the dream build day by day with all the action that gets you to the end dream of you being in good health.\nIf you want riches, then change the dream. Dream of yourself going to school, developing a career, working hard and taking the steps to arrive at the destination. If you want love, love the process. Love the dating process . Love yourself and the journey to find love.\nMake all your dreams include the beginning, middle and end. Then when you are doing the action instead of thinking to yourself, \"This is a drag. I don't like working out,\" or if you are having any negative thoughts about doing the work it takes to create your visions , realize then that every step of the way you are living your dream. You are living your dream because you made the action and journey part of your dream.", "id": "high4850.txt"}
