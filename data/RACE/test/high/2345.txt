In many areas, this light makes it difficult or impossible to observe stars and planets in the night sky.\nThere are a number of reasons why light pollution is important. One has become clear at the Mount Wilson Observatory near Los Angeles, California. Today, light from Los Angeles makes the night sky above Mount Wilson very bright. It is no longer an important reasearch center because of light pollution.\nLight pollution threatens to reduce the scientific value of research telescoples in other important observatories. They include Lick Observatory near San Jose, California and Yerkes Observatory near Chicago, Illionis.\nLight pollution is the result of wasted energy. Bright light that shines into the sky is not being used to provide light where it is needed on Earth. Poorly designed lighting causes a great deal of light pollution. Lights that are brighter than necessary also cause light pollution.\nMost people in America are surprised to find out that they are able to see our own galaxy ,the Milky Way, with their own eyes. But about threefourths of Americans cannot see the Miky Way because of manmade light.\nObjects in the night sky are resources that provide everyone with wonder.
