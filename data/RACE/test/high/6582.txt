The bullet narrowly missed 20-year-old Birmingham resident Jatari Walker who told the Daily News she is scarred by the entire experience.\n\"I can't sleep,\" she said Saturday afternoon. \"And since it happened I've had no appetite.\"\nWalker ordered a combination platter and eggroll from the Good Friend Chinese and Seafood Restaurant on Dennison Ave. Thursday evening. After paying her $7 bill she went back to her car and discovered a fly inside. \"I thought I need to take this back,\" she said.\nThe customer went back and asked for a repayment and said the owner Chun HinChing, 52, was unhappy with her because she announced her discovery in front of other customers. After an argument he repaid the money and Walker -- who is now a former frequent customer of the business -- turned and walked to the exit.\nThat's when Ching drew a handgun and fired a single shot over her head.\n\"He just shot the gun at me and I ran,\" she said, adding she could feel the bullet whiz past her head.\nBirmingham Police Department spokesman Lt. Sean Edwards told the News the owner was charged with attempted murder and was transported to Jefferson County Jail on $100,000 bail .\nPolice believe Ching intended to hit Walker with the bullet and missed, Edwards said. The bullet hit the top of the door frame of the take-out business.\nChing did not tell police why he fired at Walker, Edwards said.\nEdwards said he did not recall any previous problems at the business. He said Ching did not say why he had a weapon but added it was not uncommon for stores in that neighborhood.\n\"No one was injured from the gunshot\", Edwards said.\nCalls placed to the restaurant Saturday afternoon were not answered.", "id": "high6582.txt"}
