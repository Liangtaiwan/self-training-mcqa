The sun shines, the wind blows, and time and space seem endless. Nothing is soft. The sand and rocks are hard, and many of the plants even have hard needles instead of leaves.\nThe size and location  of the world's deserts are always changing. Over millions of years, as climates change and mountains rise, new dry and wet areas develop. But within the last 100 yeas, deserts have been growing at a frightening speed. This is partly because of natural changes, but the greatest makers are humans.\nHumans can make deserts, but humans can also prevent their growth. Algeria Mauritania is planting a similar wall around   Nouakchott, the capital. Iran puts a thin covering of petroleum  on sandy areas and plants trees.

The USSR and India are building long canals to bring water to desert areas.", "id": "high7560.txt"}
