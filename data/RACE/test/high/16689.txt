In the lab, children 5 months and older crawl   and walk up, down and over adjustable wooden slopes  , gaps and steps.\nIt may seem like the set for a new reality television show, but there are no prizes, except perhaps for the researchers. They hope to understand what makes one child respond to another, how babies adjust their look to their hands and feet to handle objects, and how these very young children adapt to changes.\nThe findings provided by these eye-trackers suggest that babies may be more capable of understanding and acting on what they see than had been thought. \"Quick looks at their mothers' faces may be all they need to get the information they want. They seem to be surprisingly efficient,\" said John Franchak who studies psychology at New York University.\nAlthough sight might largely seem effortless to us, in reality we actively choose what we look at, making about two to four eye movements every second for some 150,000 motions   daily, said Karen Adolph, also a developmental psychologist at N.Y.U. \"Sight is not passive,\" she said. \"We actively adjust our eye movements to the motions of our hands and bodies.\"\nEye-tracking studies have existed for more than a century, but the instruments involved were typically desk machines. The wearable eye-trackers that Dr. Adolph, Mr. Franchak and their colleagues use are based on equipment developed over the last decade by Positive Science, a New York company, with money from the United States Naval Research Laboratory. They were designed to help scientists. Eye-trackers are currently being used in studies to learn the differences in how amateur and professional geologists   scan landscapes and how people examine signs when looking for exits during emergencies.\nThe researchers also found that during the studies babies looked at their mothers just 16 percent of the time. \"That is lower than expected.\" Dr. Adolph said. A large body of past research has placed importance on children watching the faces of adults as they name objects to learn languages. These findings suggest children may not have to look very long to get the information they need, either from people or objects. This gives a new understanding of how much information they need, or how quickly children might process the information.", "id": "high16689.txt"}
