Although they were built thousands of years ago, they are still standing. And remember: the people who built them had only simple tools. They didn't have the kind of machinery that builders and engineers have today.\n\" I agree that the Egyptian pyramids are wonderful,\" the second man said, \" But I don't think they're the greatest wonder.

They carry out mathematical calculations in seconds that would take a person a hundred years to do.\"\nHe turned to the third man and asked, \" What do you think is the greatest wonder in the world?\"\nThe third man thought for a long time, then he said, \" Well, I agree that the pyramids are wonderful, and I agree that computers are wonderful, too. However, in my opinion, the most wonderful thing in the world is the thermos .\"\nAnd he took a thermos out of his bag and held it up.\nThe other two men were very surprised. \" A thermos?\" they exclaimed , \" But that's a simple thing.\"\n\" Oh, no, it's not,\" the third man said, \" in the winter you put in a hot drink and it stays hot, in the summer you put in a cold drink and it stays cold. How does the thermos know whether it is winter or summer?\"", "id": "middle1029.txt"}
