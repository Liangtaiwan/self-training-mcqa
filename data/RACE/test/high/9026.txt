The trouble is that they have no idea of how many stamps they have left. When they want to send something by post, it's very annoying to find out that they have run out of stamps!\nThe Internet is possible to solve the problem. The United States Postal Service has come up with a system which allows people to print their own postage stamps at their own home! This is the perfect solution for those people that have busy lives!\nWhenever you go to the post office to buy a stamp, you are buying a boring and standard postage stamp. They are red in color, and you can easily buy them on the Internet as well. For example, you can just order a regular 1st class stamp and then print it off using your own printer  .\nThese days, you can have much more fun with your stamps. You can buy them online instead of going to the post office. You can decorate, preview   and print your stamps all at your own home. You are able to use any of your own photos as part of your postage stamp as well.\nThese stamps aren't just allowed to be used in the United States; they can be used to send your mail throughout the world. They are perfect to use for many special occasions, such as weddings, festivals and even birthdays! They are fantastic!", "id": "high9026.txt"}
