The robot must be able to recognize another car, to understand that it is moving and that it will interact with it as it gets closer.\"  Stanford's entrant  \"Junior\" is a changed 2006 Volkswagen Passat whose steering, throttle   and brakes all have been modified by engineers.\n   Lasers fitted on the car bumpers, radar and global positioning systems feed data into the on-board computer to determine its location and position. Thrun predicted that advances in artificial intelligence would lead to driverless cars on the roads by 2030. \n  \"Today they can drive about 100 miles, by 2010 I expect this to go 1,000 miles, by 2020 up to a million miles,\" he said. \"By 2030 you'll be able to see them on the highway, with driving reliability that will beat humans.\"\n   \"We believe this technology will affect all of us. It is going to have enormous significance for people who can't drive because of disabilities or because they are ill or impaired.\" Thrun said he believed robot-driven vehicles would be deployed in war zones before they were seen in everyday civilian environments.", "id": "high20527.txt"}
