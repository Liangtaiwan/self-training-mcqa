Her mom, Jaimee, kept her eye on the little girl from a window. At about 4 p.m., Jocelyn walked around the corner of the building to get her bicycle. However, half an hour later, she disappeared. Jaimee called 911.\nA short time later, police officers and firefighters crowded inthe area, blocking streets and searching the neighborhood. Officers handed out photos of the girl wearing thick-framed glasses.\nTemar Boggs, 15, a school athlete in track, was with some friends moving a couch into the apartment of his elderly neighbor when one officer approached him and asked if he'd seen Jocelyn. Unfortunately, none of them had seen her. A little bit later, Temar and his friends went to check out the situation. By 6:30 p.m., Jocelyn had been missing for more than two hours, and the search team was worried that the sun would set before she was found.\nJust at that moment, Temar felt an intense emotion that he was going to find her.

Temar instantly realized it must be the missing girl.\nThe boys cycled after the car, but the driver kept moving, winding his way through the neighborhood.\nFinally, the driver had to park the car ahead of them and pushed open the passenger-side door. A girl slipped out of the car. It was Jocelyn. Temar got off his bike, and carried her to the police. The kidnapper sped away.\nA police report later identified the man as a 63-ycar-old sex offender. He is still _ .\nNeil Harkins, chief of the Manheim Police Department, says \"The boys' heroics are 'something we don't normally hear about.' It is a very brave thing for young boys to do that.\" But when asked, Temar, now a tenth-grade student at Lucy Laney High School, says \"I didn't do it for attention. I just wanted to help.\"", "id": "high8672.txt"}
