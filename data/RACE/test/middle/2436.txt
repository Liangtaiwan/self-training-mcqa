These two kinds of sports are team sports and individual   sports. Team sports are such sports as baseball, basketball, and volleyball. Team sports need two separate   teams. The teams play against each other. They compete against each other to get the best score. For example, in a football game, if team A gets 8 points and team B gets 4 points, team A wins the game. Team sports are sometimes called competitive   sports.\nAnother kind of sports is individual sports. In individual sports there are no teams. There isn't any competition. People play individual sports in order to get some exercise, not to win a game. Individual sports are such sports as swimming, skiing, and running.\nOf course, it is possible   to compete in individual sports. It is possible to keep a score in individual sports. The main difference, however, between team sports and individual sports is that individual sports can be finished alone. But team sports always need more than one person.\n,.", "id": "middle2436.txt"}
