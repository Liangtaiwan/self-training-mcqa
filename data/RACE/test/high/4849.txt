He just saw it as a bit of fun for friends and family, but when music manager Scooter Braun saw one of the videos, he flew to Justin's hometown of Ontario, Canada to sign him up. Justin was just 13.\nShortly after, Justin was flown to the US. He eventually started working with R&B superstar Usher. Justin's first album My world was released in 2009. But all the time, Justin continued to build his fan base on his YouTube account, where some of his original home videos can still be found, and where he continues to post music. \"I wasn't sending mixtapes or anything like that to record labels,\" he told us when we met him on his promotional tour for his latest film Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. \"I was just doing regular stuff at home and I just posted videos online without purpose. I would never be here if it wasn't for the Internet and YouTube.\"\nBut it isn't just YouTube that helps Justin's popularity. He also updates his Twitter account (@Justin-Bieber) regularly and has about 8.8 million followers.
