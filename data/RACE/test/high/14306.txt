Therefore, most movie channels are automatically removed form the list of TV channels for an entire family. The following are some good ones based on popularity on a global scale.\nDiscovery Channel\nDiscovery and its many channels can be considered as the founding father of informative channels on television. What National Geographic does in a scholastic  manner, Discovery tries to do in an entertaining manner--educating the masses about anything and everything.\nFox Family\nFinding a movie channel that broadcasts pictures suitable for teenagers and kids alike is very difficult unless your service operator offers you Fox family movies. This channel screens most movies before it broadcasts them, ensuring that no movie shows unacceptable material for young eyes.\nNickelodeon\nA channel very similar to Cartoon Network, it mostly shows US programs. However, their shows are sometimes a bit more mature for younger kids and better suited to kids aged 5 and up.\nABC Family\nABC started the ABC family channel in an attempt to introduce family-centered shows and serials to the public in the USA. The need for this channel was felt after ABC observed the lack of proper family type US channels.\nLiving\nIf travelling is a family hobby and better living is the motto then there is no better channel than Living.
