Several operations and speech classes later, when she was seven, we found out that Jenny had Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis .\nShe could not put pressure on the heels of her feet, so she walked on tiptoe , and when the pain became unbearable, I carried her. Jenny was fortunate, though, because she did not suffer the deformities , often associated with JRA.\nAll through grade school, and on into high school, Jenny suffered, yet never complained. She took her medicine, and I would often wrap her feet in steaming towels, and hold her until the pain eased.

She bandaged knees and ankles before every game. She gave inspiring talks and it turned out to be one of the best years for Garrett High School football Team in its history. When asked why he thought that the team was winning all their games, one team member Jack explained, \"Well, when you've been knocked down, and you can't seem to move, you look up and see Jenny Lewis, walking across the field, dragging her buckets and carrying her pillow. It makes anything the rest of us may suffer seem pretty unimportant.\"\nAt the Senior Awards ceremony, Jenny received a number of scholarships to College of Charleston. Her favorite scholarship, however, was a small one from the Charleston Women's Club. The President of the Women's Club listed Jenny's achievements, starting with her grades, and ending with an excited,\"...and the first girl to letter in football, in Garrett High School history!\"", "id": "high17189.txt"}
