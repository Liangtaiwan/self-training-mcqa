One of my friends explained that a gentleman will pour the lemonade for the ladies and show other good manners.\nToward the end of my three-week trip, I was invited by my Russian friend Nicolai Vasilevich and his wife Yulya out to dinner. At the end of a wonderful meal, Yulya asked if I would like a banana. I politely declined  and thanked her, and explained I was most satisfied with the meal. But my mind was racing: \"What should I do? Should I offer her a banana though they are as close to her as they are to me? What is the polite thing to do?\"\n\"Would you like a banana?\" I asked Yulya.\n\"Yes,\" she smiled, but didn't try to take any of the three bananas in the fruit basket.\n\"Which one would you like?\" I asked again.\n\"That one,\" she pointed at one of the bananas. So thinking about Russian politeness, f picked the banana Yulya had pointed at. Then I _ it half way and handed it to her.Smiles on Yulya's and Nicolai's faces told me I had done the right thing. Alter this experience, I spent much time letting the world know that in Russia, the polite thing was to peel bananas for ladies.\nHowever, sometime during my third trip i learned I was wrong.\n\"Oh no, David,\" a Russian politely corrected me.  \"In Russia, when a man peels a banana for a lady, it means he has a romantic interest in her.\" How embarrassed   I felt.\nSo to communicate properly with people of different cultures, we should watch carefully how people of the same culture communicate with each other. Besides, don't be afraid to ask questions about their culture.", "id": "middle2776.txt"}
