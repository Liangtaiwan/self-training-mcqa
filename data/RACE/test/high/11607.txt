I post to my blog six days a week. I take notes every day. I write in my one-sentence journal every day. Many people have told me that they find it easier to exercise when they exercise every day. If I try to do something just four days a week, I spend a lot of time arguing with myself: Is today the day, or is it tomorrow, or the next day? Does the week start on Sunday or Monday?\nIf you do something every day, you tend to fall into a routine. Routine has a bad reputation for lacking excitement. It's true that novelty and challenge bring happiness and that people who break their routines, try new things, and go to new places are happier, but I think that some routine activities also bring happiness. The pleasure of doing the same thing, in the same way, every day, shouldn't be overlooked. By repeating, you can find happiness in activities like doing dishes or sweeping the floor as well as in your beloved morning coffee-and-news routines.\nTwo geniuses whom I know of also wrote about the power of doing something every day. Andy Warhol wrote, \"Either once only, or every day. If you do something once it's exciting, and if you do it every day it's exciting. But if you do it, say, twice or just almost every day, it's not good any more.\" Gertrude Stein made a similar point, \"Anything one does every day is important and anywhere one lives is interesting and beautiful.\"\nSo if there's something that you wish you did more regularly, try doing it every day; if you do something every day, take great pleasure in it.", "id": "high11607.txt"}
