If people go \"Dutch treat\", or simply \"go Dutch\", it means that they will share the expenses of a social engagement.\nThere are many other \"Dutch\" expressions in English, many of which were invented in Britain in the seventeenth century, when the Dutch and the English were commercial and military rivals. The British used \"Dutch\" to refer to something bad, cheap and shameful. A \"Dutch bargain\" at that time was an uneven, one-sided deal; \"Dutch reckoning\" was an unitemized  account; and \"Dutch widow\" was slang for prostitute. Later centuries brought in \"Dutch courage\", for bravery caused by drink; \"Dutch concert\", for noisy music; \"Dutch nightingale\", meaning a frog; and \"double Dutch\", for incomprehensible language or talk.\nSome of the expressions are still in use today, but some are not. In fact, in American English, some \"Dutch\" expressions have nothing to do with the Dutch, but something with the German. It was probably because of the similar spelling and pronunciation that people made a mistake in distinguishing between \"Dutch\" and \"Deutsch\" (the German word for German), when German immigrants came to America in the 1700s. For instance, \"the Pennsylvania Dutch\" refers to the German descendants, instead of the Dutch descendants, living in Pennsylvania.", "id": "high5318.txt"}
