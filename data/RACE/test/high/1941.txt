A mistake on one inexpensive postage stamp has made the stamp worth a million and a half times its original value.\nThe mistake was made more than a hundred years ago in the British colony of Mauritius, a small island in the Indian Ocean. In 1847 an order for stamps was sent to a London printer-Mauritius was to become the fourth country in the world to issue stamps.\nBefore the order was filled and delivered, a ball was planned at Mauritius' Government House, and stamps were needed to send out the invitations. A local printer was instructed to copy the design for the stamps. He accidentally inscribed the words \"Post Office\" instead of \"Post Paid\" on the several hundred stamps that he printed.\nToday there are only twenty-six of these misprinted stamps left fourteen One Penny Orange-Reds and twelve Two Penny Blues. Because of the Two Penny Blue's rareness and age, collectors have paid as much as $16 800 for it.", "id": "high1941.txt"}
