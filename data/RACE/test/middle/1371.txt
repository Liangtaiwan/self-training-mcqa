Parents can help you. Teachers can help you. Others still can help you. But all these people only help you to help yourself.\nThere have been many great men in history. Many of them were very poor when they were young, and had no uncles, aunts, or friends to help them. Schools were few and not very good. They could not depend on them for education. They tried their best to learn something and never gave up till they became well-known. One of the most famous teachers in England used to tell his pupils, \"I cannot make worthy men of you, but I can help you make men of yourselves.\"\nSome young men don't try their best to make themselves valuable to the human beings. If they see their weak points and change their ways, they can be successful. They are nothing now, and will be nothing as long as  they live, unless they accept the advice of their parents and teachers, and depend on themselves.", "id": "middle1371.txt"}
