But the method has only limited success because they cannot stay long underwater, nor reach depths of over 200 meters where some of the deep-sea coral grows.\nHowever,this is not the case for Coralbots--the robots that can constantly seek out broken branches.A team of 'coral bots',each individually working to simple rules will piece together damaged bits of coral, allowing them to regrow. They are programmed to be able to distinguish between other things and the coral.The robots work together in groups,similar to bees.If one coralbot is damaged, then the others will still be able to complete the task.\nDr Lea-Anne Henry said:\"The project of using coralbots offers us the possibility to restore  the function of reefs.It is in the final stage of testing.Once ready, the researchers hope to build hundreds of _ and use them effectively in the waters off Scotland and then hopefully in the oceans across the world.\"", "id": "high14507.txt"}
