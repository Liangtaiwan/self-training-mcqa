It's a holiday!\" While you are thinking of putting textbooks aside and playing video games, let's take a look at what children in other continents usually do during their holidays.\nChildren in America don't have much homework to do. They keep themselves busy by playing camp games. A parent says, \"My daughter Shirley usually attends different camps. We don't ask her to spend plenty of time on maths problems or spelling tests.\"\nChildren in Australia take partin activities on over twenty different themes  . They learn painting, dancing, singing, history, culture and so on.
