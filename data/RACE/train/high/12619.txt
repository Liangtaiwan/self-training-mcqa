This deterioration can take different forms, one of which is the non-standard usage of the words. Its source is, specifically, Chinese culture, and its target is native English speakers. Below I give some of the common ways that the Chinese environment strikes down the native speaker's linguistic competence   .\nNet bar: In Chinese, they're called \"\", This is fine. We generally call them \"Internet cafe\" in English. The Chinese seem to think that \"\" should be translated as \"net bar\" in English, and many careless foreigners have even been misled by this idea.\nName card: In the English-speaking world, business people have lots of business meetings to discuss business. On these occasions, business people exchange specially printed pieces of paper known as business cards. In China everyone calls them \"name cards\", because in Chinese they are called \"\" and \"name card\" is a more direct translation .\nBean curd. It's called \"tofu,\" OK! This English word comes from Chinese. I know all dictionaries sold in China will tell you \"\" is \"bean curd\" in English and that may represent the two characters nicely, but \"bean curd\" is more a definition than a comfortable translation. And yet some foreigners start saying \"bean curd\" rather than tofu. Deplorable  !\nI think you see the pattern. The normal native way of saying something is replaced by a more unnatural way of saying it using other English words.\nIf you've been living in China for a while and find yourself using all of these, you might be on dangerous ground. You're going to start making a fool of yourself back home. Look out! Resist Chinglish attempts at destroying your own command of your mother tongue!", "id": "high12619.txt"}
