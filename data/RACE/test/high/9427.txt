He focuses on his passion for baseball and working hard to improve the pitches   that have kept him off the school team.\nMexican Whiteboy, by Matt de la Pena, is about a teenager's search for identity. It was named as one of the Top Ten Best Books for Young Adults in 2009 by the US Young Adult Library Services Association.\nWhen Lopez's mother decides to go to live with her wealthy white boyfriend in San Francisco, he chooses to spend the summer with his father's family in San Diego. It's a trip to explore roots and self-identity, filled with unexpected friendship.\nThere he meets Uno, of mixed heritage   like himself, also with a divorced mom. Uno understands Danny's split background and helps him improve his baseball skills. Both boys have big league dreams, but they both have to learn to come to terms with their mixed heritages before they can achieve their goals.\nAside from discussions of racism, Mexican Whiteboy takes on other issues, such as the importance of family and the negative influence of hiding the truth. It also shows how sports can draw cultures together.", "id": "high9427.txt"}
