Looking at the sea carefully, he saw that two kids in a rowboat were being pulled out to sea.\nTwo 12-year-old boys, Christian and Jack, had rowed out in a boat to _ a football. Once they'd rowed beyond the calm waters, a beach umbrella tied to the boat caught the wind and pulled the boat into open water. The boys were terrified and tried to row back to shore. But they were no match for _ and the boat was out of control.\nTim knew that it would soon be swallowed by the waves.\n\"Everything went quiet in my head,\" Tim recalls. \"I'm trying to figure out how to swim to the boys in a straight line.\"\nTim took off his clothes and jumped into the water. Every 500 yards or so, he raised his head to judge his progress. \"At one point, I considered turning back,\" he says. \"I wondered if I was putting my life at risk.\" After 30 minutes of struggling, he was close enough to shout to the boys, \"Take down the umbrella!\"\n\"Let's aim for the pier ,\" Jack said. Tim turned the boat toward it. Soon afterward, waves crashed over the boat, and it began to sink. \"Can you swim?\" he cried. \"A little bit,\" the boys said.\nOnce they were in the water, Tim decided it would be safer and faster for him to pull the boys toward the pier. Christian and Jack were wearing life jackets and floated on their backs. Tim swam toward land as water washed over the boys' faces.\n\"Are we almost there?\" they asked again and again. \"Yes,\" Tim told them each time.\nAfter 30 minutes, they reached the pier.\n,.", "id": "middle4034.txt"}
