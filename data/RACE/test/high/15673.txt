Yesterday he proudly claimed in court that despite his complete lack of medical experience or qualifications, he had saved several people's lives. He had even been allowed to assist a surgeon during an emergency operation on a patient who was about to die on something she had swallowed.\n\"I watched one of those TV dramas about a hospital and suddenly I felt like playing one of the roles myself. So I put on a white jacket and a stethoscope and walked around one of the biggest hospital in London. At first I just watched. Once you learn how doctors talk to patients, nurses and others doctors, it's easy to take people in,\" he said.\nOne of the patients he treated was Laura Kennan. She had been knocked down by a car and fainted. When she came to in hospital, York was standing over her.\n\"He looked very professional. He told me his name was Doctor Simon. Then he gave me some sort of injection,\" she said. And then he suddenly cleared off when a nurse asked who he was. She didn't think there was anything wrong. \"I would never have realized he was a fake if a policewoman hadn't showed me his photograph a week later. When the policewoman told me who he really was, I could hardly believe my ears.\"\nJudge Raymond Adams told York that he was \" shocked and horrified\" that he got away with his deceiving for so long. And they sentenced him to eighteen months in a special prison for criminal with mental disorders.\n\"I can only hope that this will not lead to further problems. After all, you will have considerable opportunity to study the behaviour of the psychiatrists who will look after you while you are there. If you try to persuade people that you yourself are a psychiatrist after you are set free, I shall make sure that you are given a much longer sentence.\" Judge Adams warned York.", "id": "high15673.txt"}
