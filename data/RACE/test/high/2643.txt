Well, I suggest you try the beautiful and green Isle of Wight (IOW). The Isle of Wight is one of the main tourist attractions. Here is some information on a few of the attractions on the IOW.\nDinosaur Isle\nIt is located in Sandown, a seaside town on the southeast coast. It's a large, lovely museum, both fun and educational. Here you can see a large fossil collection of all kinds of dinosaurs, as well as a gift shop. You can walk into the past and then the future, learning about the history and the development of the civilization of dinosaurs that lived 120 million years ago.\nRobin Hill Country Park\nThe park is in the beautiful countryside, and is suitable for children's parties and games. It has five new gardens, and offers great opportunities to see and take pictures of the rare red squirrels.\nThe West of the Wight\nHere we have the Marine Aquarium, the Archaeology Exhibition and the Model Railway. They offer another opportunity to combine fun with learning. This is a great place to see ancient boats crossing the narrow strait between the island and the mainland.\nThe Wight Bus Museum\nThis museum is run completely by unpaid volunteers. It has a bus collection stored in what was once a warehouse . Most of the buses in the museum date back to around the 1910's.\nWith all of these choices, what are you waiting for? IOW Tourism welcomes you!", "id": "high2643.txt"}
