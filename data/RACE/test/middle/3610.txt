She would gladly walk miles to school, but her mother needs her badly   at home. What will her future be?\nIs it hard to believe? For Maria Pestora, it is real life.\nBut with just 52 pennies a day, you can sponsor   a child like Maria. Through\"Save the Children\",you can help Maria's mother get the tools and ways she needs to turn their poor food into a good dinner, and get the money she needs to buy clothes and school things for Maria.\nTo help Maria most, your money is put together with that of other sponsors. Building schools, hospitals, bringing in clean water is what\"Save the Children\"has been working on since 1932.\nFor you there are many rewards. You have the chance to write to or hear from the child you sponsored, to receive photos or progress reports, to know you are reaching out to another person, not with a handout  , but a hand up. That's how \"Save the Children\" works. But without you, it can't work. Please take a moment now to fill in and post the form below to help a child like Maria.\nIt can make a difference in his/her life and yours.\nFor the children\nDavid Li Guyer\n,.", "id": "middle3610.txt"}
