Any essay containing material plagiarized  from another source will be disqualified .\n2.Manuscripts should be typed double-spaced,with the student's name,address,and grade level on a separate sheet of paper.\n3.Essays must be turned in by 4:00 p.m. on November 30.They can be brought to Mrs. Elton in Rom 104 or to Mr. Markham in the school library.\n*Essay-Writing Tips\n1.Catch your readers' interests--Your opening should immediately pull your readers into your essay. Asking a question or starting with an story,quotation,or surprising statement is a good way to do this.\n2.Create a picture--Use active words that show your readers what is happening. Instead of telling your readers vaguely that \"the room was disordered\",paint a picture using active verbs and lively adjectives.\n3.Have a purpose--Well-written essays do more than just describe an incident or express a viewpoint,and they also communicate a message.\n4.Check for mistakes--Read your paper over to check for mistakes. Ask another student to read your paper and make suggestions. Another pair of eyes will often spot a mistake you've overlooked.\n5.Format your essay--Neatly type your essay on white paper. Choose an attractive cover for submission. The computer lab will be open after school from 3:15 to 4:45 p.m. each day this month so that students can use the computers.\n*Prizes\nWinning essays will be published in the Centerville Times. Every contestant will also receive a free pass to enter one school activity or athletic game this year.\nFirst Prize:   $150\nSecond Prize:    Dictionary and thesaurus\nThird Prize:     Pen set and journal\nSpecial thanks to the Centerville Writers' Association for the prizes to help encourage our aspiring authors.
