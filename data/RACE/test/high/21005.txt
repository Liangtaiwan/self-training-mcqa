Users are also able to provide written feedback on their friend's exercises directly from their mobile devices.\n\"The most effective way to learn a new language is through total immersion  ,\"said Sarah Gontijo, founder and CEO of Hello-Hello. \"However, not everyone has the opportunity to live in another country. Hello-Hello World brings the convenience of connecting with native speakers anytime, from anywhere. This can help users not only learn the language but also understand the culture.\"\nHello-Hello World lets users synchronize   their information with the Hello-Hello Cloud and then access the content from any mobile device or computer. The application is first being released for the ipad and will become available on a variety of platforms, including the iPhone, Android and Blackberry.\nThe application arrives at a time when tablet   computing is driving the creation of new educational tools, such as Hell-Hello World. Many schools and colleges are finding ways to adapt mobile technology for classroom learning. \"The market is hot for such pioneering in education and social networking,\" said Gontijo. \"Hell-Hello promises to be the invention that will set the ball rolling and bring innovation to an industry that has seen little change over the years.\"\nTechnology research firm Gartner predicts that app-store downloads worldwide will double to $17.7 billion as the year closes, and that app-income will hit $15.1 billion, tripling the impact of last year's sales. App-downloads are expected to continue to jump to 185 billion by 2014, at which point worldwide tablet sales are projected to surpass   208 million units.", "id": "high21005.txt"}
