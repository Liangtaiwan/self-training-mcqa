The rabbits were born at the University of Istanbul as part of the cooperation between scientists from universities in Turkey and Hawaii.\nThe rabbits glow to show that a genetic operation technique can work efficiently. \"The green is not important at all--it's just a marker to show the experiment can be done successfully,\" said University of Hawaii associate professor, Stefan Moisyadi.\nTo produce the glowing effect, researchers injected jellyfish DNA into a mother rabbit's embryos. Then those embryos were put into the mother. Similar experiments have resulted in glowing cockroaches  and cats.\nEventually, the researchers hope the technique can lead to new ways to produce medicines, Moisyadi said.\n\"The final goal is to develop animals that are able to produce beneficial molecules in their milk that can be cheaply extracted , especially in countries that cannot afford big factories that make drugs, which usually cost US$1bn to build. Then they will be able to produce their own protein-based medication in animals,\" Moisyadi said.\nThe rabbits are expected to live as long as non-glowing rabbits, but Moisyadi said he understands people can object to this kind of experimentation involving live animals. \"To the people against, I say: think, what are the benefits and what is the harm?\" Moisyadi said. \"And if the benefits outweigh the harm, let's go with the benefits.\"\nMoisyadi started developing the project in 2006, and researchers are now waiting to see if pregnant sheep produce similar results.", "id": "high18393.txt"}
