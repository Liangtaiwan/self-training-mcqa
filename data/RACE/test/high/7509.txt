I think animals can sense disaster. They have a sixth sense. They know when things are happening,\" H.D. Ratnayake, deputy director of Sri Lanka's Wildlife Department, said on Wednesday.\nThe waves washed floodwaters up to 3 km (2 miles) inland at Yala National Park in the southeast, Sri Lanka's biggest wildlife reserve and home to hundreds of wild elephants. \"There has been a lot of evidence about dogs barking or birds migrating before volcanic eruptions or earthquakes. But it has not been proven,\" said Matthew van Lierop, an animal behaviour specialist at Johannesburg Zoo.\n\"There have been no specific studies because you can't really test it in a lab or field setting,\" he said.\nOther authorities agreed with this conclusion.\n\"Wildlife seem to be able to pick up certain phenomenon, especially birds. There are many reports of birds detecting coming disasters,\" said Clive Walker, who has written several books on African wildlife.\nAnimals certainly rely on the known senses such as smell or hearing to avoid danger such as predators .\nThe idea of an animal \"sixth sense\" is a lasting one that the evidence on Sri Lanka's damaged coast is likely to add to.", "id": "high7509.txt"}
