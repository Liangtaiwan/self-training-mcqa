I enjoy the selection of produce and fresh bakery items. I have been a long time Supermart shopper and hope to continue for many years. I have found, however, that I must make a separate shopping trip to one of your competitors because there are many items your store does not carry. This becomes inconvenient for me, as my time is valuable, and I do not like to make two trips. Your low prices and excellent customer service keep me coming back to Supermart, but I would be a more satisfied customer if I could find all the items I need in one place. \nSpecifically, I have never been able to purchase nacho cheese soup at your store. I can find other flavors   of soup, but your store does not carry nacho cheese soup, a common ingredient   in many of my recipes. In addition, I can only find large wonton wrappers, while many other stores carry both large and small and offer a more varied selection for their customers. Another example is Regent Brand Chili Seasoning. Though it is not a leading brand, it is still common on the shelves of other grocery stores in this area and is superior in flavor to its competitors. \nI sincerely hope to continue a relationship with your store, and I hope that you will consider the possibility of expanding your goods to be more competitive. \nYours truly, \nBob Watson", "id": "high17398.txt"}
