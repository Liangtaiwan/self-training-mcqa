At first, it seemed really scary for me to live on my own. But I had to overcome the true challenge!\n    Luckily, I met seven new friends, six boys and one girl. They were really nice and I loved their company. We hung out most weekends. We cooked, watched movies, chatted and shared jokes! It was amazing -- until something unexpected happened !\n    One of my friends was diagnosed with kidney   stones which needed to be removed as soon as possible. But our friend could not afford the surgery. He tried to get help from our other friends but they refused him. My heart cried for him! Our friends abandoned him just when he needed them most.\n    I didn't know how to help him because I didn't have any money either. But I never lost hope. Instead I tried to think of other options. I told him not to worry because he might find a way somehow and everything would be all right.\n    So I went to the hospital with him. I talked to the surgeon, asking him to do the surgery for him and promising to pay the expenses the next day (As if I had that money). I must have been convincing because the surgeon agreed to do it! Now, how was I going to get that much money?\n    All I knew was that I needed to help my friend! I tried to borrow money from other friends but I failed. I tried selling my things but no one wanted them. Then I had to talk to my boss. I asked him if I could have my next two months salary in advance -- without even thinking on how I would survive for two months without money.\n    He was surprised and asked me why. I told him that I had a friend who was really in need.  Luckily, he gave my two months salary without hesitation! As soon as I had the money I ran to the hospital and paid all the bills.\n    Friendship may not only be found in happy moments. Sometimes you can find it on the toughest time in your life!", "id": "high18364.txt"}
