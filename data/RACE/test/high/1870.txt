The survey found that searching online is one of the leading ways that people look for a second opinion though doctors are still the main source of health information.\nForty-four percent of people are actually looking for doctors or other providers when they search for health information online. Another finding of the survey: Two-thirds of Internet users look online for information about a specific disease or medical condition.\nThe Internet has also become an important source of emotional support for people with health problems. Susannah Fox says one in five Internet users has gone online to find other people who have the same condition.

All of their lab work is right there.\" Dr. Livingston says the software has increased efficiency, reduced costs and improved relations with patients.", "id": "high1870.txt"}
