People didn't have modern machines. There was no modern medicine, either.\nLife today has brought new problems. One of the biggest is pollution. Water pollution has made our rivers and lakes dirty. It kills our fish and pollutes our drinking water. Noise pollution makes us talk louder and become angry more easily. Air    pollution is the most serious kind of pollution. It's bad to all living things in the world.\nCars, planes and factories all pollute our air every day. Sometimes the polluted air is so thick that it is like a quilt over a city. This kind of quilt is called smog.\nMany countries are making rules to flight pollution. Factories must now clean their water before it is thrown away, and they mustn't blow dirty smoke into the air.\nWe need to do many other things. We can put waste things in the dustbin and do not throw them on the ground, there will be less pollution.\nRules are not enough. Every person must help to fight pollution.", "id": "high1067.txt"}
