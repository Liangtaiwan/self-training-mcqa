Visitors have fallen to around 3 million a year from 3.5 million since Ling Ling's death.\nSince a boat collision near the Diaoyu Islands in September, Sino-Japanese relations have been at a low point. The media outlets expressed hope that bilateral relations will improve with the arrival of the pandas.", "id": "high15810.txt"}
