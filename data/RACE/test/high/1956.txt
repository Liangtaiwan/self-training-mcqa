The HR manager interviewed him and then watched him cleaning the floor as a test.\n\"You are employed,\" he said. \"Give me your e-mail address and I'll send you the application to fill in, as well as date when you may start. \"\nThe man replied, \"But I don't have a computer, neither an e-mail. \"\n\"I'm sorry,\" said the HR manager. \"If you don't have an e-mail, that means you do not exist. And who doesn't exist cannot have the job. \"\nThe man left with no hope at all. He didn't know what to do, with only ten dollars in his pocket. He then decided to go to the supermarket and buy 10kg tomatoes. He then sold the tomatoes from door to door. In less than two hours, he succeeded to double his capital. He repeated the operation three times, and returned home happily with 60 dollars.\nThe man realized that he can survive in this way, and started to go every day earlier, and return late. Thus, his money doubled or _ every day. Shortly, he bought a cart, then a truck, and then he had his own fleet of delivery vehicles. Five years later, the man is one of the biggest food retailers in the US.\nHe started to plan his family's future and decided to have a life insurance. He called an insurance broker and chose a protection plan.\nWhen the conversation was concluded the broker asked him his e-mail. The man replied, \"I don't have an e-mail. \"\nThe broker answered curiously, \"You don't have an e-mail, and yet have succeeded to build an empire. Can you imagine what you could have been if you had an e-mail?\" The man thought for a while and replied, \"Yes, I'd be an office boy at Microsoft!\"", "id": "high1956.txt"}
