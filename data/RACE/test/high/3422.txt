That game and others that promote large consumption will be banned from April and publicans   will have to ensure free tap water is made available to the drinkers.\nThe government says over-drinking costs Britain up to 12 billion pounds a year and has announced that any pubs that go against the new mandatory code   will face severe punishment. For instance, publicans and vendors   could lose their licenses, be fined up to 20,000 pounds ($32,750) or face six months in prison.", "id": "high3422.txt"}
