At the very beginning, one student from our team got the ball and quickly shot a basket. Oh, it went in, 2:0. All our classmates cheered.\nBut after a few minutes there were some mistakes and we lost eight points. I changed two players, but it didn't help.\nAt that time all our teammates felt worried and we even quarreled with each other angrily.  \"It's no use crying over spilt milk!\" I shouted, \"We must face it !\" Let's think about our mistakes and stop making them!\"\nWe had a short meeting . The second half of the match began. There was a big change. At first, our team got the ball and I shot from the three-point line at once. The ball did a beautiful curve and went straight into the basket.\nI become very confident. The other team was still very strong.\nA good chance came! I got the ball again and shot into the basket! 12:9! I couldn't believe my eyes! Am I that good at shooting? How could I get so many points?\nWe stayed in the lead. Finally the score was 18:16. We won!", "id": "middle357.txt"}
