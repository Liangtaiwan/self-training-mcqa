El-E is a robot that is designed to get everyday objects for people with disabilities.\nAbout 1.5 meters tall, with a single robotic arm that can pick up objects at different heights, El-E is equipped to discover what its owner wants and then go and fetch it. The user can point a location to the robot using a \"point-and-click\" way of interaction, which provides a direct way to tell the robot which object to handle or where to go. The robot can adapt the position of its arm in order to grasp the object.\nAfter successful early trials, some scientists expanded El-E's functions and tried to combine voice commands with the laser   in order to do more complicated tasks, like opening doors. The robot recognizes words such as \"pull\" or \"push\" and performs the action on an object illuminated by the laser. In order to add more functions, project director Prof. Charlie and his colleagues are focusing on programming El-E to locate and fetch common household items such as a hairbrush, a bottle of pills or a cell phone.\nThe robot is also designed to learn from its mistakes. \"If it fails to fetch an object, it will recognize it and try again,\" Charlie said. Formal studies have shown El-E to be a good worker. In 127 out of 134 trials, the robot successfully picked up the requested object.", "id": "high13305.txt"}
