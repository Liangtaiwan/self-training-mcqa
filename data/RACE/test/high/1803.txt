Brittany Blythe was one of them.\nIn seventh grade,Brittany Blythe dreamed of being a cheerleader . Her school's coaches were less than enthusiastic. \"They said. 'I don't know how you'll be able to do it'. \"she recalls. \"'You won't be able to do it'.\"\nBut Brittany,now a junior at Strath Haven High School near Philadelphia,refused to give up. And when the junior school cheerleaders won a tournament last year, she was right there,dancing and cheering with the rest of the team.\nNot bad for someone whose legs were cut off below the knee when she was two years old.\nBrittany,18,was born without shinbones --\"just blood and muscle tissue,\"as she puts it. When she tried to walk, her legs twisted.\nAfter the operation, she adapted quickly. \"From day one,I basically jumped up and wanted to do everything,'' she says. Prostheses allowed her to move around upright. But too slowly to keep up with her friends. Brittany's solution was to take the legs off and walk on her knees something she still does when safety and comfort permit.\nShe has been rarely discouraged. Other children laughed at her through the years,especially in junior high school,but she says the challenge only made her stronger. Now she's trying to convince her coaches to let her remove the prostheses and be a flyer. The cheerleader who's thrown in the air and caught by her teammates.\nBrittany doesn't think her problems put her at a disadvantage. \"My disability was the first thing I had to get through., and that's going to prepare me for the future. \"she says. \"It's all just a test:If someone throws you a difficult problem,what are you going to do?\"", "id": "high1803.txt"}
