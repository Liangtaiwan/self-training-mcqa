When he was in elementary school, he asked his mother to take him to parks in their community so he could collect empty soda cans to recycle.  His mother agreed, as long as he saved part of the money he earned for college.\nBob's mother remembers Bob as the most determined of her seven kids.  Bob's persistence paid off.  On Friday, he will become the first person in his family, originally from El Salvador, to graduate from college.  And he's graduating with university honors.\nFor his honors thesis he researched unmanned solar-powered airplanes, which BYU students have been building and testing for about 10 years.  Bob's study helps discover the best way to fly a solar-powered airplane so that it uses the least amount of power.  The goal is to design and build an airplane that flies indefinitely.  Bob's thesis helps lay the foundation for this work.\n\"My parents were always diligent,\" Bob said.  \"They often tell us hard work leads to success. \" Bob's father taught him to read at the age of 3, and his mother is currently a student at Utah Valley University in a way to becoming a dentist.\nBob acknowledges he overcame some obstacles to get where he is.  For starters, English is his second language.  He also faced stereotypes .  Although Bob never doubted that he would be a college graduate, other people assumed he wouldn't because he didn't come from a family of high income.  There were other obstacles as well, but Bob viewed them all as opportunities.\nBob's mother says she feels very happy and proud that her son is about to graduate with honors, and remembers the sacrifices he's made to get there.  \"He has worked very hard.  He started something, and now he has finished it,\" Cathy says.  \"I have always told him, 'If this is your dream, then you can get it! Keep working hard and you can get it!'\"", "id": "high10707.txt"}
