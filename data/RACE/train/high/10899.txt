But immigration has brought more of a taste for goat to America from all over the world.\nExperts from the University of Illinois offer some questions for people to consider if they are thinking about raising goats.\nFirst of all,do you understand that there always has to be someone to care for the goats?\n*How much land do you have available? And how good is it? Poor ground may support two to four goats on half a hectare.Better grassland can support six to eight. If goats and cattle share the land,two goats can be added for each cow. The goats will eat weeds and other plants that cattle do not like.\n*Do you have buildings for the number of female goats you plan to keep during winter? An open,cold,dry barn is better than a closed,warm barn where the air is wet.\n*Do you have the equipment to clean barns  and to harvest hay  to feed your goats? Or will you get someone else to do it,or buy the hay?\nThe experts say a profitable business in goat meat may take three to five years to establish.And, of course, there are no guarantees .", "id": "high10899.txt"}
