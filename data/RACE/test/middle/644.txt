A famous teacher was speaking to the students. He was holding up a $100 bill. Then he said to over 300 students, \" Who would like this $100 bill?\" The students put up their hands at once. Then he said, \"I am going to give this $100 bill to one of you, but first, let me do this.\" He made the bill into a ball. Then he said, \"Who wants it now?\" The hands went back into the air. \"Well,\" he said, \"What if I do this?\" and he dropped it on the floor and stepped on it. He picked up the dirty bill and said, \"Who still wants it?\" Hands went back again into the air.\n\"My friends,\" he said, \"you have learned a valuable lesson today. No matter what I did to the $100 bill, you still want this bill. Many times in our life, we are dropped and stepped on. We feel as if we are worth nothing. But remember, no matter what has happened to you, you will never lose your value. You are always valuable to those people who love you. Your value doesn't come form what you do or whom you know, but who you are.\"", "id": "middle644.txt"}
