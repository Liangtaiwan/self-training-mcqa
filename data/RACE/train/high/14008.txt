Well, I would like to share my experiences with you.\nThe other day when I was out with a friend and her daughter Jane at a restaurant, Jane ordered an apple dessert, which was the most attractive dish in that restaurant. However, when she had a bite of the pie, she shouted loudly, \"Mom, why does it look good but tastes like rubber?\" My friend was uneasy. Then the waiter gave us another dish.\nA child can say funny things. I was at a friend's home for tea and her son, Mark, wanted her to get up. His mom replied, \"I can't, because my foot has fallen asleep now.\" Little Mark then sang a song and asked, \"Mom, will it wake up now?\" We laughed together.\nThe other day we were having an interesting conversation over lunch and my friend, an animal activist   , was arguing with another group member. Her son Tommy suddenly stood up, \"Mom, people should never be allowed to shoot extinct animals!\" That was funny and the child did manage to turn the argument into a pleasant conversation.\nWell, children sometimes really surprise us. I think we can have a lot to learn from them. They can help us understand the simple world through their eyes.", "id": "high14008.txt"}
