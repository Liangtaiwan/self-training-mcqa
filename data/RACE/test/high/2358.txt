He seemed most unfriendly and not at all concerned about my intended purchase. I bought nothing,and marched angrily out of the store. My hostility  toward that clerk increased with each step.\nOn the outside,standing by the road,was a darkskinned young man in his early twenties. His expressive brown eyes met and held mine,and in the next instant a beautiful, dazzling  smile covered his face. I gave way immediately. The magnetic  power of that smile dissolved  all bitterness within me,and I found the muscles in my own face happily responding .\n\"Beautiful day,isn't it?\"I remarked,in passing. Then,I turned back.\"I really owe you a debt of gratitude ,\"I said softly.\nHis smile deepened, but he made no attempt to answer.A Mexican woman and two men were standing nearby.The woman stepped forward and volunteered, \"Sir, but he doesn't speak English.Do you want me to tell him something?\" In that moment I felt transformed .The young man's smile had made a big person of me.My friendliness and good will toward all mankind stood ten feet tall.\n\"Thank you?\" The woman seemed slightly puzzled.\nI gave her arm a friendly pat as I turned to leave.\"Just tell him that,\" I insisted.\"He'll understand.I am sure !\"\nOh, what a smile can do! Although I have never seen that young man again, I shall never forget the lesson he taught me that morning.From that day on, I became smile-conscious, and I practice the art anywhere and everywhere, with everybody.", "id": "high2358.txt"}
