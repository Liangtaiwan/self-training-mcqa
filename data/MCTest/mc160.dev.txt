Luna the hawk wanted some socks. It was the middle of winter and sitting on tree branches
made her feet very cold. Luna hoped that her friends could help her find some socks. She
flew to the old maple tree where Olive the owl lived.

"Olive, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?" she asked.

Olive the owl looked surprised. "Luna, I have no use for socks because my legs and toes
have thick feathers. Go visit one of the animals that walk on four legs. They might have
extra socks you could borrow."

Luna flew across the field and landed next to the icy creek. Rose the raccoon was teaching
her six babies how to wash their paws. The water was very cold, but the babies were having
fun.

"Rose, my bare legs and bare toes are so cold, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?"
begged Luna.

Rose laughed hard. "Silly Luna, I do not have socks. Look at my legs and feet. They are
covered with thick, warm fur. I'm sorry I cannot help you. Go visit the humans. Sometimes
I tip over their garbage cans at night when I am looking for food. Once I saw a pair of
socks."

Luna was very afraid of humans. Her grandmother and mother had warned her about them. She
was told that some humans are mean and hurt hawks. Her feet were so cold that it was
difficult to grip tree branches. She became brave. She flew to the farmhouse on the big
hill. When she landed on the roof, she could not believe her eyes. She saw socks! In late
autumn, Henrietta the human had put laundry outside to dry and she had forgotten to bring
in one tiny pair of socks. The socks were hanging on the clothesline by two wooden
pins. Luna used her powerful beak to break the pins. She put on the socks and then flew
back to her home in the huge tree. When she landed, her feet were warm and dry. Luna was
very happy.

It was a beautiful sunny and warm day. I was working outside in my garden. I was pulling
weeds which is not my favorite job, but I was enjoying the day. I live by a lake so
sometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake. It is so beautiful and it
makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in
or near the lake.

On this day, I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. I got up from my garden
and walked to the lake. I kept hearing this strange sound. It sounded like someone talking
in a very low voice. I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of
the time. The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to "say" to
other lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and
short. Then there is the "where are you" call which is long, slow and loud. But this sound
was not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot
anything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totally
given up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was it
coming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around to
the other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it is
not a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a father
lake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat
fish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to
swim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. I felt very
special that I got to see this. It was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than
gardening.

Once there was a young boy named Bret who had a cat named Wolfgang.  The boy had really
wanted a wolf for a pet, but his mother said wolves liked to hog the bathroom and liked
to blow things down and they snored.  So the boy had to call his cat Wolfie.

He had also thought about naming his cat Sir Purrsalot.  Bret himself planned to become a
knight when he grew up (or maybe a cowboy) and thought Sir Purrsalot sounded like a good
name for his brother knight.  The difficulty there was that Wolfie didn't purr a lot.  He
purred when he was being fed or petted, but no one could say he purred a lot.  Plus Bret's
mother said knights liked to poke things with their swords and they also liked to hog the
bathroom and they clanked.

So Bret was left with a cat named Wolfgang.  The neighbors gave him strange looks when he
stood in the front yard in the evening and yelled "Wolfie!  Here Wolfie!!!", to get
Wolfgang to come in for the night.  But Bret didn't care what anyone else thought.  He had
a Wolfie and maybe he'd end up becoming a pet doctor when he grew up instead.

Once upon a time, there was a dog named Puddles. Puddles was lonely because he lived in an
area where there were no other dogs, but only cats. Day after day, Puddles would have to
eat cat food and do cat things in order to fit in with the rest of his group. He found it
very boring and Puddles was sad. Puddles didn't even look like a cat!

All of the other cats teased Puddles. "You're too big," they said. "You've got too long of
a nose!" "Why are you panting like that?" Puddles knew that he was different.

One day, Puddles chose to run away from all of the cats. The cats laughed at him. What a
stupid dog! Didn't he know that there were monsters in the woods that could eat him?
Puddles didn't care, because Puddles was sad enough to try.

So Puddles packed up his things - his squeaky ball, his water dish, and his bone - and
headed off into the woods. He was finally happy! All of a sudden, Puddles turned. He
smelled a funny smell. It smelled like something he had never smelled before. He turned
around, and what did he see but another dog!

Puddles was so happy, he barked with joy. He went home with the other dog, who was named
Mittens, and to his family. Puddles was never lonely again.

Once upon a time there was a princess who lived in a high tower and she was not allowed to
leave because of her mean mother. One day she chose to leave but her mother would not let
her. The princess climbed out the window of the high tower and climbed down the south wall
when her mother was sleeping. She wandered out a good ways. Finally she went into the
forest where there are no electric poles but where there are some caves.  There she met a
young man who was running. His name was John. John asked the princess why such a beautiful
woman like her was out in the middle of a forest. She said that she had been trapped for
her whole life by an evil woman who said she was her mother. The man said that he would
take the princess to a castle that was near. He also said that he thought that she may be
the missing princess. As they go through the forest they run into many problems. They see
that they are lost and have no way of finding where to go. After several days pass, the
princess climbs up to the top of a tree in order to find out where they are. She sees that
the castle where they want to go is not that far away and near a mountain. After thinking
of the best way to get there, John and the princess go to the castle where they live for
