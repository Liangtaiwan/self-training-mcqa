After three whole months away, I was back home with my brand new opinions, attitudes and tastes. How could they watch such terrible television programs? I, the English Literature major with Shakespeare and Milton and James Joyce, could hardly bear to sleep under the roof of a house whose few bookshelves held thrillers and bound editions of the Reader's Digest. I'm sure my family was glad to see the back of me when, at the end of the holiday, I packed up my books and headed back up to university in the north of England.\nBut the next year must have been even more painful to my parents: I didn't show up at all. Now, I don't think there's anything wrong with young people spending a little time away from their families and with their friends.  It's part of growing up, something you need to do if you are to become properly independent. However, if you're not going to be home for the festival, you should at least have the decency to telephone and say you're not coming.\nIn English we have an expression, \"wet behind the ears.\" A person who is wet behind the ears is so immature, that they don't know how to dry the back of their head after a bath. Just before the following year's holiday I fell ill, quite seriously so. I'm sure my own behavior contributed to my getting sick: staying out too late, not eating properly--perhaps you know someone like the person I was then. I lay in bed with a fever, feeling very sorry for myself.\nI'm sure you can guess who came to my rescue. My long-suffering parents got in their car and sped up the motorway to rescue their son from the consequences of his own irresponsibility.\nI hope I'm a better son now; if not, it's getting a little late in the day if I want to change. I've worked in China for nearly 10 years and so I don't get to see them as often as I like, but my parents are online all the time so we talk many times each week. And this Spring Festival I will be flying back to England for a visit.\nI'm really looking forward to it.", "id": "high15255.txt"}
