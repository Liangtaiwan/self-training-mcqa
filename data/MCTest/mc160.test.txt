It is almost summer time. Spring has been very long and very rainy. Winter was very warm and very long. In the winter the snows falls on the ground. It covers all the grass. It covers all the trees.  It covers all the flowers.  

In the winter, the chipmunk goes to sleep. The chipmunk works all summer long to gather enough food for the winter. The chipmunk gathers berries. The chipmunk gathers pine cones. The chipmunk drops the pine cones off our roof and rolls them to her favorite hiding place. Boom!  Boom!  Boom! The pine cones sound so loud when they drop off the roof!

The snow melts away in the spring. It is off the ground in our yard by the month of May. In June, there is still snow on the mountains. The snow on the mountains is still there until July.

In May the grass starts to grow. In June, the flowers bloom again. In July, we go swimming in the lake.  

We get to play all summer. We do not have to go to school. We do not have to gather pine cones for food. We get to play outside and we get to have cook outs. We are not chipmunks. We are children.

Our mom makes us lemonade in the summer time. Our mom takes us to the beach. Our mom lets us have a lot of campfires. Our mom mows the lawn.

It is summer time and now we play for 90 days and the chipmunk works for 90 days.

In the winter we work and go to school and the chipmunk gets to sleep.

I am glad it is summer and I am glad that I am a human child and not a chipmunk. I am glad that we get to be awake through all the seasons.

I like spring. I like fall. I like winter. My favorite time of all is, for sure, summer!

It was very warm for February. Anna and her brother, John, played outside in the beautiful, sunny weather. Dad was washing his car. When Mom came home with the groceries, Dad sent the kids to help carry bags. They ran to the garage to help her. But when they got there, Mom was kneeling on the ground near where their bikes were parked, petting a gray cat with long hair.

"Can we pet her?" Anna asked.

"Be careful," Mom said. Anna knew these directions were for her brother, who was often rough with things.

"She's fat," John giggled.

"She's not fat. She's pregnant," Mom told him.

"What's that mean?" John asked.

"It means she's going to have kittens." Anna said. "Can we keep her?" Anna begged. "Please?"

Mom and Dad looked at each other.

"We could take her to the pound, or she could stay outside here," Mom said. "Long-haired cats give you rashes."

"But you always said you wanted one," Dad told Mom. "Short-haired cats don't bother me, and if she stays here, we have to give the kittens away. Let's send her over to your parents' farm. She can live in the barn, and then if one of the kittens has short hair, we can keep that one."

The kids were excited. They named the cat Socks because she had white feet, and they went to visit her every day. Socks had her kittens in April, and, to everyone's excitement, two of them had short hair. Dad said that since they were brother and sister, they could keep both kittens.

Yesterday, Emily and Evelyn went to the zoo with their mom. They left the house right after breakfast so that they would be there when the zoo opened.

On a sunny day in July, Sylvia left the front gate open. From the spot where Rex was napping in the grassy yard, he had listened to the sound of the gate sliding open, and waited for it to snap shut. It didn't. The click of Sylvia's shoes faded into the distance, and yet the snap of the shutting gate didn't come. Finally, Rex pushed himself up on one paw so he could look towards the front of the yard, where the gate moved in the breeze. Rex moved slowly towards the gate at first, but as he neared the sidewalk he shot through the opening, his shiny black fur twinkling in the sun as he sped down the street. Rex ran from block to block through the neighborhood, with no leash to pull him back. When all four legs started to burn from running, Rex slowed down and started sniffing the grass around him. His stomach growled and he hoped he'd find some food in the grass. All he found was sidewalk chalk, a few little black ants, and flowers that made him sneeze. The sun was going down, and Rex thought about Sylvia coming home to rub his ears and fill his food bowl. He looked up and down the sidewalk for his home. Nothing. Rex was lost. He stood completely still and raised his ears as high as they would go. He sat and listened, and listened and sat. Just as the sun passed over the mountains in the distance, Rex heard, from very far away, the soft "click click click" of Sylvia walking towards the house. Rex ran home.
