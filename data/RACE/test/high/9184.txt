With Zheng's usual _ and simplicity, the book avoids sugar-coating reality. Instead, it illustrates the potential dangers in everyday life and provides possible solutions.\nZheng recalled that when he saw his new-born baby in the hospital, the first thought that hit him was to do his utmost to guarantee his son's safety.\n\"Safety is of the greatest importance to a human being,\" said Zheng. \"If the person is gone, nothing else will matter.\"\nAccording to Zheng, there is no preaching or soapboxing in his book. He said that he just wanted to talk and tell the plain truth to the children in an easily understandable way.\nThis line of thought will be echoed in the theatrical reproduction, said director Guo Yan. She also said that the play will place emphasis on multimedia effects and the interaction with the families.\n\"Theatre may not ensure the children a path to professional esteem and better jobs in society, but it does have the power to give them strength (at heart),\" said Huang Qin.\nHuang also calls for consistent attention to child safety, pointing out the lack of universal education and effective legal channels.\nThe show is expecting an estimated audience of more than 100,000 people during its domestic tour in the upcoming year.", "id": "high9184.txt"}
