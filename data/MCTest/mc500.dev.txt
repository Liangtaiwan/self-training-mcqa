One sunny morning, Stewart chose to go to the beach. He knew that a rainstorm was going to arrive on Saturday and wanted to enjoy some sun before it arrived. 

Stewart laid on his belly and began reading his newspaper. As he was enjoying the sun and the newspaper, he saw a bug crawl across his blanket. At first Stewart thought it was an ant, but the bug was moving too slowly to be an ant. As Stewart leaned in for a closer look, the bug cried out, "Excuse me, sir! Can you help me?" Stewart was surprised and jumped to his feet. "You can talk!" he shouted. "Yes," said the bug. "Please help me! As you might know, there is a rainstorm coming into town. Unfortunately, I do not have a place to call home. I need to find somewhere to sleep before the rain washes me away!" Stewart felt sad. "Gee," he cried. "That sounds terrible!"

Stewart thought about the problem. "Perhaps you can stay at my house," he said. The bug jumped for joy and said, "Oh, that would be wonderful!" The two traveled back to Stewart's house and the bug found a soft spot to sleep.

The next day, the sky had darkened and rain clouds appeared all over town. Just as the news had said, a rainstorm had arrived. When Stewart woke up, he looked for the bug but could not find him. Then, he saw something flying around his house. "Thank you for letting me sleep here last night," said the butterfly. It was the bug! "I knew I could not change into a butterfly if I was out in the rain. I won't forget your kindness." After speaking, the butterfly flew away. Stewart stood in his doorway and shouted, "Goodbye!"

Jane's doll, Samantha, was a magical doll. Jane kept Samantha hidden from her friends, even Julie, who was her best friend. Jane didn't want all the other girls from school, like Wanda and Ruth, to find out that she had a magical doll. Samantha could do things other dolls couldn't. Jane would whisper in her ear a secret word, and all of a sudden Samantha would come to life, hopping around, running all over. But Samantha did more than run, she could talk. Jane told Samantha everything, and Samantha understood. One day, Jane was naughty and lied to her mother. Jane's mother put Samantha on top of the refrigerator where Jane could not get to her.

It was a cold day when John made up his mind to go outside and check the fence.  There had been things missing from the back yard, and he was starting to think there was a criminal at work.  He put on his coat and started walking through the snow back to the long metal fence at the back of the yard.  It seemed like a lot longer walk than last summer when it was hot.

Sure enough, he found how the crook had gotten in.  A tree, weighted down by the snow, had fallen on the fence on a windy day and broken a section.  He got out his toolbox, and with a tool, cut some sections of wire.  He used the wires to fix the fence.

Thunder can move a seesaw. This is very important to know if you ever see what I saw. One day, I was walking home when I saw a squirrel on a seesaw near my house. It was running up and down, and all around, playing by itself. Suddenly, an ox appeared from nowhere. It came up to the squirrel, walked around the seesaw for a bit, then sat down on one end. As you know, an ox is a very big animal, so the seesaw threw the squirrel off and high into the air! The squirrel flew so high that it passed the buildings. It passed the birds, it passed the planes and stopped in the clouds. When it was there, it made friends with the clouds and asked one of the clouds a secret question. The cloud said okay, and sent the squirrel back to the ground. The squirrel fell and fell for a long time. Finally he landed on the seesaw, but the ox didn't move. "Where were you?" the ox asked, "Just talking with a friend," answered the mouse. I was watching and listening to everything, so I stayed, waiting. Soon enough, a loud CLAP of thunder came from the clouds and threw the ox off of the seesaw and far, far away. So, you see, thunder can move a seesaw.

Pester came running into the room. He came to a fast stop when he saw the dog. He'd seen a dog before, every cat has, and he used to live with a black dog named Henry, but he'd never seen a brown one before. It seemed strange to him, but not as strange as it was to see Linda the brown chicken in the living room last spring. That still confused him. 

He thought he liked this dog, not because of the color, but because it was small. And it was so hairy. It was a like a mop that could run around. He jumped on his favorite chair and looked down as Maggie ran under it. She was kind of cute for a dog, Pester thought to himself. He layed down on the chair and pawed at her as she ran in a circle under it. He tapped her ears as she went by, and waved his tail like a flag trying to get her attention. After a little more of this, Pester curled up in a ball on the chair and took a nap.

Jimmy swam around the pond. He was a duck. He was wet, but he was a duck and didn't care. He ate some bugs. He saw some worms on the bottom, but wasn't interested in them, or in the bread crumbs, or the hot dog the boy had dropped. He kept on swimming and swimming. He was a mess. After he had eaten his food, it was afternoon. The sun was setting, and Jimmy wanted to rest in the sun, and sleep. He found a nice place to sit, and began to rest. Falling asleep quickly, he slept for a few hours. When he woke up it was dark outside. He had missed dinnertime, but there were always those worms at the bottom of the pond. Jimmy ate quickly, and was soon ready to swim more. The pond was small, not a lake, or a river or a stream. He swam around for a little longer, and soon it was ready for bed in the nest, where he slept with his family Billy, Susie, and Doug. The other animals were sleeping as well, the dog and the cat on the porch. The cow was sleeping in the barn. And last the kittens in their box.

Once upon a time there was a little boy who had a rock. The rock was his favorite toy. He would throw his rock at trees, or roll his rock down hills. Sometimes he would stand at the river shore, dropping his rock in the water. He thought it was great fun to listen to the rock splash.

One day, the little boy met a brown cow. "Moo!" said the cow.

"Hello," said the boy. "Would you like to see my rock?"

The boy held out his rock for the cow to see. The cow looked at it. Then it picked it up in its mouth.

"Moo," said the cow.

"Hey," the boy said. "Give me back my rock!"

The boy tried to pull open the cow's mouth. Then he tried sticking his fingers in the cow's nose, so it would open its mouth to breathe. Then he tried tickling the cow, but it wouldn't open its mouth.

One day, a pink moon was looking down at an empty sand land. Although the pink moon could see all the lizards and cacti in the empty sand land, nobody could see the moon! The pink moon felt so lonely. So, the pink moon called on the sun for help. The great sun was very busy high in the sky, for it was his job to shine over the sand land, and it was hard to get his attention. So the moon wiggled closer and closer to the sun every second. The second turned to hours as the pink moon inched toward his friend, slowly moving across the sky. Finally, the sun saw the moon and asked, "Pink moon! What are you doing here? Don't you know the sky is my home during the day? Your time is coming soon enough. Look, I'm falling now toward my bed on the end of the earth..." But the pink moon could not be stopped and kept moving toward the great sun. "But great sun, I become so lonely during the day when your light is so bright the animals in the sand land can't see me. Please let me join your light during the day this once!" By this time, the great sun and pink moon were only inches apart. The great sun said, "Though by day you disappear, I always remember you are here. Come to me now. Stand in front of me, and show the sand land your shine!" So the pink moon inched in front of the great sun. At first, covering part of the sun's circle, then more, then...a complete covering of the sun! The pink moon was shining with the power and light of the sun! All the lizards, cacti and every animal stood still in awe of the daytime pink moon!

One morning, I woke up and went downstairs for breakfast. I fixed my normal breakfast: hot pickles, marshmallows, and ketchup. First I heat up the pickles on the stove, then I put the marshmallows in the toaster as I pour out my small plate of ketchup. Delicious! I eat it every morning, often with a tall glass of lemonade.

I sat down at the table to eat, and looked out the window at the birds in my yard. Sometimes I see skunks outside, and once I saw a small pot-bellied pig. But today there were only a few flamingos. I opened up the book I was reading, "All About Birds." I had finished the chapter on pigeons, and was moving on to robins.

While putting ketchup on my marshmallows, I felt something tickling my neck. I looked down, and there was a daddy long-legs, climbing up! I had never seen one so close to my face. 

"Er, what's up?" I asked. 

"Not much," he said. "I smelled the hot pickles, and wanted to have a taste."

"Sure, little guy," I said. I put a small piece of pickle on my finger and held it out. While I was doing that, that sneaky daddy-long-legs ran down my arm. He grabbed the rest of my pickle, and ran out the door! And that was the last time I gave a pickle to a spider at breakfast.

Paul woke up to the sun shining in his eyes. He was so excited! Today was the big day for the baseball game and he was very excited! He rolled out of bed and jumped in the shower, whistling a happy song. Downstairs he could hear his baby brother, Mike, crying and he had to giggle to himself. He got out of the shower and pulled on his clothes. He looked at the calendar on his desk and smiled knowing yesterday, Friday, had been the last day of school. "Hi, Mom! No school Monday," he laughed. He gave his baby brother a kiss on the cheek and grabbed a piece of bacon. "Is that all you are eating, Paul? You need to have a good meal before you leave." said mom. "Yes, I am meeting John and Terry at the playground and I am late."  He grabbed his glove and bat and ran outside, right into a mud puddle from last night's rain. He got to the playground and John was wiping his head. "Whew, it is very hot now!" "It is going to be a hot summer since it was so cold this winter. It is hard to believe last month there was snow on the ground." The boys jogged to the playing field and shook hands with the other boys. "This is going to be a great game, the first of the summer." one of the boys said. The game started and everyone had a turn. Paul's team was behind by two points. Terry took his place at the plate. "Batter up!" The pitcher threw the first ball. "STRIKE ONE!" Then the second and crack, the bat hit the ball and it flew through the air. Terry ran to the first base.

It was Tuesday.  Tuesday was Square's favorite day.  Wednesday was nice because it was always Spaghetti Night.  Saturday was great because of the morning cartoons.  But Tuesday?  Tuesday was the day it always went to visit its friend Diamond.

It was a beautiful day!  The spring wind was blowing, and the sun was shining.  Square and Diamond went to play by the river.  

They were having a great time.  They swam.  They fished.  They played hide and seek.

Suddenly, the wind picked up.

"Hey, Square!  Would you like to see a trick?"

"Sure Diamond!  What is it?"

Diamond took a string out of its pocket.  Diamond tied it to her, and then she tied it to a tree.

"Watch this!"  Diamond jumped into the wind.  Suddenly, she was flying!  She floated.  She swooped.  She played with the clouds and the birds.  She flew faster.  She flew slower.

At first, Square was amazed.  But slowly, Square started to frown.

Diamond landed in front of her friend.  "What's wrong?"

"That was amazing!  It looks like a lot of fun.  But I am not shaped like a kite.  I can't do those amazing things like you."

Diamond smiled.  "Yes you can, Square!  Stand on your tip-toes!"

So Square did.

"Now, go look at yourself in the river."

Square walked to the river and looked down.  But he did not see a square.  He saw a diamond!

Diamond handed Square the string.  "Now jump!" she said.

Square jumped.  He jumped as high as he could.  Just as he started to fall, the wind blew and picked him up.

He was flying, like Diamond!

He floated.  He swooped.  He played with the clouds and the birds.  He flew faster.  He flew slower.

He soon landed.  The sun was setting, so they said goodbye and made plans to meet again next Tuesday.

It was a beautiful day.

The sun was rising in the morning and the birds were waking up. A mother bird was watching over her baby eggs in the nest. She laid four eggs yesterday, some white and some spotted. She had been keeping them warm so that her babies would soon be born. Little cracks appeared on the eggs and they started to grow and grow. Little "cheeping" sounds could be heard coming from inside, and soon the eggs cracked open. Featherless baby birds were inside, crying for food. The mother had nothing to give, so she quickly flew to the ground and looked in the dirt for food. She saw some worms wiggling in the ground. She picked a few up with her beak and flew them up to the nest. The babies were well fed with the worms, and the mother kept them all warm in the cold spring morning.

Once upon a time I had a dog named Toodles. He was black and white and had long floppy ears. He also had very short legs, but really big paws. Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles' favorite game. Toodles loved playing fetch. One Saturday, Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. Toodles wasn't having it! He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better. After that, whenever he would see a duck, Toodles would run the other way.

"I don't think I can win the race" Tim told his parents over breakfast. His mother asked "Why not?" but his father was silent. Tim knew his father didn't believe he could be a racer: only last year, he had sent Tim to a doctor to ask why his son wasn't a better runner. The doctor told him Tim could be anything he wanted to be, and maybe he didn't like to run. 

Tim, who had always preferred a good book to P.E. class, wanted to show his family that he really could be what they wanted him to be, so he spent his allowance on a pair of green running shoes and signed up for his school's Spring Fun Run. 

Tim answered, "I'm going to try to win, but Angela is so quick! No one ever beats her at recess." 

"Well, we'll be there for you, either way" his mother said.

Tim took an apple and walked to the bus. Since the race was after school today (school was letting out at 3:00 today, instead of 3:15), he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began. He didn't even bring his new book with him, an action book starring an orphan named Simon that Tim sometimes pretended to be.

3:30 arrived and the race was about to begin. All the other students had brought running shorts, but Tim was going to have to run in his school pants. Suddenly, he saw that his shoes were untied. As he bent down to tie them, one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee, making him fall down right as the race began. By the time he got up and tied his shoes, he saw he would finish in last place, as the other kids were much farther ahead of him. 

It was almost 4:00 before Tim saw the end of the run. By the time Tim reached the finish line, the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small, as some kids had been finished for a long time. Tim's father asked, "What took you so long? I'm surprised to see you here at all! Why did you sign up for this when we all knew you wouldn't win?" 

Tim thought about why he signed up. It wasn't about winning the race, or making his father proud. It was about finishing, and showing himself that the doctor was right: he could be anything he wanted to be, like his favorite character, Simon.

1: multiple: Why does Tim start out so far behind?
 A) He trips over his shoelace.
*B) He is knocked down.
 C) He gets sick.
 D) He can't run.

2: one: What time does the race start?
 A) 3:15
 B) Tim doesn't know
 C) 4:00
*D) 3:30

3: multiple: Why does Tim run the race?
 A) To make Angela like him.
 B) To win a prize.
 C) Because his father wants him to.
*D) To show that he could be anything he wanted to be.

4: one: What does Tim bring to school?
*A) An apple
 B) Nothing
 C) A book
 D) Shorts

Bill and Sarah chose to meet at the park on Saturday to play ball and have a picnic. They went to the same grade school together and lived on the same street down from the park. Sarah does not often like boys, but for a boy, Bill was alright. Most boys like Tom and Mark are stupid and a real pain, but Bill was a lot of fun to play with and didn't do dumb things like putting a booger on her back during recess. When Bill and Sarah arrived at the park, they first played ball in the grass near the playground. Then they chose to pretend that Bill was a monster and Sarah was the monster hunter. Sarah chased Bill all over the playground. They went in and out and up and down. Bill ran under the slide and stepped in a puddle. He didn't get hurt but he sure got plenty wet. Playing the monster game was the most fun that they had at the park that day. Later they sat in the grass for a picnic. They both took off their shoes so that Bill's feet could dry off and so that he wouldn't feel silly without shoes. Sarah took out her lunch and laid it out next to her. She had dried fruit and cheese and a peanut butter sandwich. Bill opened his lunch bag and found a coke, a bag of chips, and a ham salad sandwich. Sarah wanted to trade Bill his bag of chips for her fruit. He said that would be a fair trade and they enjoyed their lunch together. After they had their lunch, they lay back in the grass and watched the clouds. Some clouds looked like animals or shapes. Bill spotted one that looked like a reindeer. Sarah pointed to one that looked like a drum. Finally Bill and Sarah got up and brushed off the grass and headed for home.

Lions get very lonely sometimes but they have a difficult time trying to make friends. Lions have big teeth, sharp claws, and sometimes, they are very cranky. They don't always get along with other animals or humans, so they have to get rid of their anger and their crazy emotions to make and keep friends. Zebras and lions like to play tag, but sometimes it gets a little rough and zebra gets hurt. When that happens, a nice lion needs to say sorry and to try to find another friend. A lion might go up to a chicken and smile, or maybe a lion might bring a horse some flowers or food to make him or her less nervous.

Joe went out to the field and was feeding the horses and cows. When he was done, he saw the tractor his father told him not to get near.

The bird by the river chirped twice before breaking into song, to tell all the other animals to sing along. The dog barked, the other birds sang, the squirrel squeaked, and the rabbit clapped its ears together. The cat did not because his mouth was hot from some very strong mustard. He thought to himself that he wouldn't have eaten that hot dog if he knew it was on it. He tried to look for water, but that mustard drove his nose crazy and he couldn't smell anything. Not even water. 

Luckily for the cat, cats have very good eyes, and he saw a puddle out of the corner of his eye. He ran to it. He wondered why the water was kind of yellow, and thought it must be from the leaves floating in the puddle. The cat took a big drink. It made his tongue felt so much better that it made him want to sing, but the others were done and the bird had flown away.

I stepped inside my mother's car and dropped my backpack on the floor as my face filled with excitement. Today's the day that we're going to the candy store and picking out a new treat to have after dinner. Some people may like going to the movies, or the game room, or even to parks, but going to the candy store once a week and getting to see all the different colors and taste all the different treats is my favorite activity. As soon as we pull up, she tells me to not run around too much inside, but I'm so excited I barely hear her. She opens the door and we walk inside where the clerk first welcomes us. Since we do this each week, he calls me by my name of Trevor and says that he's come up with a few candies for me to try. 

I walk over to the table and see three types of M&M's laid out. He knows I'm not a big fan of peanuts so he left out the peanut kind, instead giving me mint flavored, cookies 'n creme flavored, and white chocolate flavored. They all taste great and the clerk asks which I like the most. It takes me a bit to choose, but I finally choose the Mint as this week's choice. He rings us up at the front desk and says that since we buy from his shop so much, he's going to give us a sale, so we think it'll be a nickel or a dime or even a quarter off. Actually, the clerk ends up cutting it half off! We thanked him and went on our way as I tried not to eat all the way home.

John wanted to have a birthday party for his son, Mike. John and his wife Sara knew that their son loved clowns, as did their daughter Jane. So they looked up a place to have a clown come to his birthday party. When the clown arrived, ten of Mikes friends showed up to watch the show.

One day, Joey and Jimmy went swimming together at their Aunt Julie's pond. Joey woke up early in the morning to eat some food before they left. He couldn't find anything to eat except for pie!

There once was a little monkey who lived in a zoo. He was a tiny brown monkey, smaller than all of the others. He was quieter than the others too. He was so quiet, in fact, that his mommy monkey made him wear a small blue bell around his neck so that she could find him. Even when the little monkey was very quiet, whenever he moved, the bell would jingle and his mother could find him.

One day, this little monkey had been running around under the yellow sun for a long time, with his bell going "jingle jingle." He started to feel tired.

The girl and her mother and father got in their car and went home.
