In other words, why would your customers want to talk to their friends about their experience of doing business with you?\nWhen you perform your service or deliver your product competently  ,  you are just doing what the customer expects. In order to increase the number of the customers who want to share their good experience with their friends, you must make your service impressive, going beyond what is expected.\nRecently my daughter Dawn and I had lunch with my team members at the Campbell House. The food and service were truly excellent. My daughter asked for her leftovers   to be packed. They were returned to her in aluminum foil   shaped like a swan .
