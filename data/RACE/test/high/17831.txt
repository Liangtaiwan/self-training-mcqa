She had boxed many times before. But this time, the prizes were higher than ever. If she won this fight, Claressa would win a spot on the US Olympic Women's Boxing Team.\nThe fight was difficult. Claressa was up against a two-time US champion. \"Her whole game plan was to hold me against the ropes so I wouldn't hit her,\"says Claressa. Claressa didn't give up. She won the fight. And that wasn't all. She also won the title of outstanding fighter for the whole tournament!\nClaressa, now 17, started boxing when she was just 11. She was inspired by her dad. He had been a fighter when he was younger. But when she first told her dad that she wanted to box, he didn't support her. \"He told me, 'No! No! Boxing is a man's sport,'\" Claressa remembers. \"It made me so mad.\"\nClaressa wouldn't back down. \"I wanted to fight. I knew that whatever I put my heart and my work into, I was going to be successful at it,\" she says. Finally, her dad took her to the boxing gym to start training. She was the only girl. \"Everybody was looking at me,\" she says.\nClaressa didn't worry about fitting in. She just did her best. Claressa now has a boxing record of 23 wins and zero losses. \"I think you're awesome,\" her dad told her not long ago. He's proud that she proved him wrong.\"I'm still proving people wrong,\" says Claressa.\nBoxing can be dangerous. How does Claressa feel when she steps into the ring? \"I'm not nervous,\" she says. \"I'm determined and calm.\" She knows it's important to stay confident. \"I've never gotten into the ring thinking that a girl can beat me,\" she adds. But Claressa takes the competition seriously. \"I always tell myself it's going to be harder than I think,\" she says. \"I fight them all like they are world champions. If I think it's going to be easy, I'm done!\"\n  We asked Claressa to imagine stepping into the ring at the Olympics. Would it feel any different from her other fights? \"No,\" she says. \"Just a fight. Just another girl in my way.\"", "id": "high17831.txt"}
