The Statue of Liberty's rough history is explored in \"Liberty's Torch\".\nFrederic Auguste Bartholdi is an all-but-forgotten figure in American history. He was, however, responsible for one of the most enduring symbols of the United States: the Statue of Liberty. A Frenchman from Alsace, he designed and built the Statue of Liberty which stood on Bedloe's Island in New York Harbor. How this statue came to be is the fascinating subject of Elizabeth Michell's new book \"Liberty's Torch\".\nThe power of Mitchell's narrative is convincing . We recognize the Statue of Liberty now as a symbol of hope and opportunity for a nation of immigrants. At the time, though, people could not see that-nor did they even imagine that. Instead, the construction of the statue was born of one man's desire to set up a great monument.\nFor this reason, perhaps, \"Liberty's Torch\" relies on Bartholdi as the connecting thread. Bartholdi went to Egypt to make photographic copies of the main monuments. On the boat, Bartholdi met and began a lifelong relationship with Ferdinand de Lesseps, the man who would build the Suez Canal. Maybe it was this friendship, or maybe it was seeing Egypt's huge monuments, but finally the trip inspired Bartholdi's dream to create the largest statue ever built. Failure to bring this to completion in Egypt, followed by his exile   from Paris, led Bartholdi to sail to America.\nBy explaining the Statue of Liberty's hard history and showing Bartholdi's brave spirit, Mitchell has done a great service.", "id": "high10729.txt"}
