Would you like to know how successful people usually think and what drives them? Here I am going to tell you the key to success that successful people share.\nFirst of all, successful people never blame someone or something outside of themselves for their failure to move ahead. They realize that their future lies in their own hands. They understand that they can't control things in life, such as nature, the past and other people. At the same time, they are well aware that they can control their own thoughts and actions. They take responsibility for their life.\nPerhaps what most separates successful people from others is that they live life \"on purpose\" --- they are doing what they believe they are put here to do. In their opinion, having a purpose in their life is the most important element that enables them to deal with things around them. They hold the view that when they live their life \"on purpose\", their main concern is to do the job right. They live what they do. People want to do business with them because of their commitment. To live their life \"on purpose\", successful people find a cause they believe in and create a business around it.\nBesides, they never give up easily. Once they have set up goals in their life, they are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals. To achievers always bear in mind what they don't have forever. Rather than see this as negative or depressing, they would use the knowledge to _ themselves on and go after what they want energetically and passionately.\nSo keep in mind what successful people always hold to be true so that you will have a clear idea of what you should do to be successful in life.", "id": "high8313.txt"}
