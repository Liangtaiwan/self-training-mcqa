Morrison is the first black woman to receive a Nobel, and so honored before her in literature are only two black men:Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian playwright, poet and novelist, in 1986; and Derek Walcott, the Caribbean-born poet, in 1992. But Morrison is also the first and only American-born Nobel prizewinner for literature since 1962, the year novelist John Steinbeck received the award.\nLike Song of Solomon, Love is a multigenerational story, revealing the personal and communal Legacy  of an outstanding black family. As Morrison scholars will tell you, Love is the third volume of a literary master's trilogy investigating the many complexities of love. This trilogy began with Beloved(1988), which deals with a black mother's love under slavery and in freedom. Jazzy(1993), the second volume, tells a story of romantic love in 1920s Harlem. This latest novel looks back from the 1970s to the 1940s and 50s.\nThe emotional center of Love is Bill Cosey, the former owner and host of the shabby Cosey's Hotel and Resort in Silk, North Carolina, described in the novel as \"the best and best-known vacation sport for colored folk on the East Coast.\" We get to know Cosey through the memories of five women who survive and love him: his granddaughter, his widow, two former employees, and a homeless young girl.\nThe latest novel, Love, had been described in the promotional material from her publisher as \"Morrison's most accessible work since Song of Solomon.\" This comparison to her third novel, published in 1977, was an effective selling point.", "id": "high7314.txt"}
