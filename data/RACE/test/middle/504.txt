But a terrible accident changed his fortune .\nOne spring he took his class to visit a place of interest. The children saw a lot of interesting things and had a good time there. But on their way to school, their bus was hit by a truck because the young driver was drunk . Five students died and more than half of the children were injured in the accident. He didn't know how it had happened and was very sad about it and after he came out of hospital, he left the school and became a policeman. He tried his best to stop the drivers from breaking the traffic regulations . He worked hard and was strict with the drivers. So they were afraid of him.\nOne afternoon it was very hot. Mr. Evans was on duty. He was standing at the crossing and watching the traffic. Suddenly he saw a car rushing towards the crossing. It ran so fast that it almost hit a man on a bike.
